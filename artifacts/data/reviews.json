In terms of location they're nestled between downtown and Capitol Hill so commuting was relatively easy (note: we relied on cabs and Lyfts). To top it all off they have an adorable cat Brigit who was utterly delightful to spend time with. \n\nWould recommend/stay again!"

She was there to meet us and had all sorts of maps/guides to help out. She also pays attention to details with the chocolates/mints in the room to the fridge space provided and even tea. \n\nThe place is an old building but in such a terrific area - easily you can walk to some of the major sights (ex. Space Needle, Key Arena, the monorail, etc). The room & bed were comfortable and true to the pictures. There was wifi and a tv for you to kick back and relax on the couch with. So if you want a place to have a nice hot shower and a good sleep after a long day out, this is a great place for you. \n\nIf you're lucky enough you'll also get to meet Charlie, who was such a friendly and lovable kitten - and we're normally not even cat people! :) "

I had a great stay. They're both warm, welcoming people that go out of their way to make you feel welcome. The house is located in a residential neighborhood (quiet & safe), but not too far from downtown Seattle (20 min by bus or so?), the U district, Ballard, Wallingford... Especially the last two are nice if you're looking to a nice place to have lunch/dinner. I would definitely recommend staying with Adam & Courtney!  "

The room is spacious and the bathroom is like a spa including heated floors and towel warmer.  \n\nMiesha is a wonderful host.  She is helpful and communicative and her home is comfortable. When I arrived, she made sure that the furniture in the room included what I needed for my stay.  She switched out a chair and added a desk which I have used quit a bit.  She worked with me to extend my stay and was very accommodating of my ongoing search.  Plus, she keeps plenty of coffee on hand which has kept me going on even the rainiest of days. I can't imagine finding a better place to stay while starting out my life in Seattle!  I highly recommend this room."

Every aspect of the visit was as expected or better - from arrival to departure - from the neighborhood to the condo.  Location is easy walking distance to nearby medical center, coffee shops, other neighborhoods and downtown which made it convenient for us to connect with family living nearby. Between walking, public transit and Uber, we had no need to rent a car for the two weeks. The condo is well kept and was a comfortable refuge each night after a long day out and about. All in all it was a very pleasant experience.\n"

The neighborhood is quiet (other than some ambulance noises because you're near a hospital) and there are several great restaurants, bars, and shops within walking distance. We walked most places but using uber/Lyft is also very cheap. Overall, great place to stay and enjoy Seattle like a local!"

The apartment was comfortable and well equipped. The king-size bed in the main bedroom could be difficult for an older or mildly disabled person to maneuver - it's low to the floor and you can only get in on one side. The twin beds in the second bedroom are a little short (we are a tall clan:-) but they worked better than a pull-out sofa for the couple of days other family members joined us. The bathroom is nice (all marble with a small Jacuzzi). And an added plus is the washer and dryer right in the apartment. The location was perfect! I got all my Christmas shopping easily done in two days with all the great stores close by.  Ultimately, we enjoyed ourselves in this space for two weeks and would recommend the accommodation to anyone considering a visit to Seattle."

The house has everything you need, is cosy, clean and big! Having an awesome computer there to use was a big help for us! Most of all we'll miss the garden. We were spoiled by the weather this month and spent a good deal out there. Just lovely. Also the location is super: far enough from the city to be superquiet at night, yet so close at the same time. Hop on the bus on the corner of the street, hop of downtown! \n\nBefore we arrived, we received a long welcome mail where every question we could've had was answered.\nKush was a super host and made sure everything was there for us and had tips and tricks ready to help us get around the city. Kush, you're a great guy, thanks for everything! \nBased on the couple of times we briefly met and the evidence all around the house, Devin is an awesome guy with a heart of gold. I could spent hours listening to him, I'm sure he's got quite some stories to tell! Even when he wasn't around, we knew he was available by phone 24/7, but we never needed to ask anything. \nThanks guys!\n\n"

Because of that, part of the floor is heated! \n\nJulie's home is clean with minimal decorations and a modern feel. The neighborhood is quiet and safe; it is within walking distance to bus stops and downtown. There's also lots of coffee shops, restaurants, and bars a few blocks away. It's a great, secure location. For nights in, the WiFi is incredibly fast and the bed is soft and very comfortable. The view from the roof is to die for. \n\nWhile Julie was often busy with work and her personal life, it was always a pleasure to speak with her at the end of the day. This is a great place and I highly recommend renting from her! "

        "comments": "This unit is akin to longterm corporate housing.  The condo unit is clean and neat, but pedestrian.  The kitchen has pots and pans, dishes and utensils, but it lacks cooking oil and any spices (other than salt and pepper).  The knives are dull and need to be sharpened (making them dangerous).  The unit is also managed by Stay Alfred, which describes itself as a corporate manager.  Nothing wrong with the unit, but it was not what we expected.  Normally, our Airbnb stays have been second homes or run by families.  The location is excellent and in the heart of downtown Seattle.  Walking distance to the Pike Marketplace, Whole Foods and clothes shopping.  The location is also across the street from the USDC, which would make for an excellent war room for litigators and lengthy trials.\n\nThe reception and unit is \"cold\" and uninviting.  For example, shampoos and conditioners are in little bottles like in a hotel.  This place is strictly business.  Again, nothing wrong with the place, just different from our expectations."

It keeps the bathroom warmer and the bedroom slightly cooler than the rest of the house, which feels very comfortable to me. Thumbs up to the coffee machine that makes delicious espresso.  I don't know about other people, but I also enjoyed the slightly unconventional bathtub. And the bed is super comfy! Just be careful with the low ceiling in the bedroom, and the narrow stairs leading up to the bedroom. (These are accurately described in the listing, so no complaint there.)"

As I had a limited amount of time to explore Seattle, Chelsi was proactive in giving me recommendations on places to eat, things to see and tips on transportation.  The chef had whipped up an awesome salad (that looked as good as it tasted) before I headed out for my half day of sightseeing.  I learned quickly to be respectful of his work space (the kitchen) and washed my hands in the bathroom instead and would recommend doing this as well if you stay there.  After a long day of sightseeing, he was kind enough to bake some delicious cookies and cook bacon for a midnight snack.  As I was leaving the country the next day and my flight was too early for him to cook me breakfast in the morning, he offered to cook me breakfast at 1am before I went to bed and it was great!  I came to the 7 Leaf B&B for a unique experience as I do not smoke or consume cannabis in any fashion.  The hosts are very professional and I never felt pressured to partake in smoking.  I actually really enjoyed the late night conversation that I had with the host and other guests and learned about cannabis in a non-judgmental environment.  I would definitely stay here again in the future."

We opened the window in the living room but it was so loud from the traffic since the place is right under the 15 freeway. Was hard to hear one another. The fridge was dirty. The bathroom shower is very little and small flow.  Parking was on the street under the freeway because the host had his car parked in the space in the parking garage. Our car was safe. But there is a homeless camp right there. \n\nThe location was great and convenient. We had a late lunch at the cafe across the street when we first arrived and watched the Seahawks game. We are runners, so we ran from the place to nearby parks and trails. That was nice. The description also says right on the Lake, it's not. It's across the street with businesses and residential in between. No view of the lake from the place. "

The room is on its own floor and so fairly separate from the rest of the townhome. I really enjoyed the tiny well-maintained garden outside of the room. He gave me free run of the common areas of the house and tried to make my stay as pleasant as possible. His dog is super friendly, although she sheds a bit more than I expected as someone who has never owned a dog. The internet worked very well, but the TV not as much. There's a ton to do close by and super easy, fast access to most of my favorite Seattle neighborhoods. Very comfy bed and helpful amenities made my stay very nice."

We had no car but if we had, we still would have taken the bus a half block away to downtown as we were able to see so much of the area without the burden of driving and parking in the city. It truly was wonderful at the end of a long, eventful day to have a home away from home to relax in."

We both needed to shower before our event and were unable too. Although it was nice, I would have chosen another location had I known there was not ample hot water."

Just as we experienced during our first stay, this home served us so incredibly well! The spaciousness, the location, the comfort, and the amenities made for another amazing vacation. We were in Seattle for Christmas. Family from California, Colorado, and Washington all met in Seattle for one week. Our Colorado relatives had not before visited Seattle. To quote one of them, Lindsay's house felt so much like Seattle that he wondered where Tom Hanks was. Lindsay and Jason made us feel more than welcome. They made sure we had Christmas lights outside and decorations inside. They even left a supply of Christmas wrap for our use. I am convinced this home feels so warm and welcoming because of the people who live in it. One of these days I bet we'll meet Lindsay and Jason and when we do, we'll most likely feel like we're with family."

The place had everything that was advertised and really did exceed expectations.  The space is very nice and comfortable and the rooftop deck is really spectacular!  Sadly, we didn't get a chance to meet Marie but we met a few neighbors and they were all extremely nice.  And, even in her absence, Marie was very helpful and organized.  This is a great place to stay in the city, close to bus routes and walkable to many fun attractions.  I would recommend this place to any small group, particularly one traveling with little kids.  Thanks, Marie!"

I met Dario later in my stay and he is kind and helpful and seemed genuinely concerned about my stay. The neighborhood is quiet as is the house. A big grocery store is several blocks away and the kitchen had all the essentials for preparing my own food. Even the guests in the house were friendly and we had great conversations a few evenings. There is a bus stop two blocks away if that is how you travel. Lake Washington is one block away and beautiful even in this time of year. Being able to do laundry in the house is a big plus. A great place to stay in Seattle if you don't have be downtown in the middle of everything. I really enjoyed the peaceful area where the house is located. Any of the rooms in this house would be recommended. "

Wifi, drawers for storage  and cable TV rounded out the experience and gave us just what we needed to get my MIL settled in and comfortable.\n\nThe parking spot is a terrific bonus as well.  \n\nWe hope to book this spot frequently in the future as it's just ideal fro one or two people to stay comfortably.\n\nThank you, Donna!

The apartment is beautifully decorated and comfortable. \n\nAlthough I didn't meet Ben, he came across as a warm and kind person. Super responsive, easy-going and accommodating (allowing for a late check out on Sunday). \n\nIf ever you get to Seattle, I would highly recommend a stay here."

Everything about the listing is accurate and the suite has all accommodations you need with a great amount of space. Sarah and her family make you feel very welcome and were so helpful throughout the entire stay. The neighborhood is great with easy access to grocery stores and a 2 min walk from the bus stop. \n\nI would definitely recommend staying here, whether for a weekend or extended stay. It's the perfect amount of space with everything you need in a great location. "

The location is also fantastic and within a few blocks of great restaurants and boutique shops.  On a final note, the bed was very comfortable and the linens good quality.  We will definitely be back and would recommend this place to anyone."

This place end up behind my sis in-laws house so quick walk to see the family. Bonus quick uber or lyft ride to Canon which has the best cocktails in town. Condo is three stories and has heated floors in the master bath. Super spacious for Seattle compared to other places. Bed is super soft. Two tubs, master is super deep so perfect for soaking. Chris was cool too, hooked us up with some local cookie dough. It was pretty good. Book it! You won't regret. "

Full disclosure: I live across the street with my family - but rented the space for extended family when our home was bursting at the seams. Beth and Pierce have created a wonderfully welcoming home that I was happy to have the family stay in. \n\nThe hosts are all around awesome people. I think the price is great on this space - a real steal for the neighborhood! \n\nThanks, Merideth Kelly"

My hungover friends savored that Sprite the next morning, let me tell you.\n\nChris was very easy to communicate with, and the house is only blocks from the D-line bus that is a straight shot into downtown. Short walk to all of the great food and coffee Ballard has to offer--this place is a perfect location to be steeped in Ballard awesomeness while having easy access to other parts of the city."

The house was very clean but also fun and inviting with lots of artwork. The cats, Betty and Nancy, were both really sweet.\n\nThe location was ideal because it's close to Capitol Hill but the neighborhood itself is quiet and residential. We hope to visit Seattle again and we'd love to stay at Ron's again if we can."

We did feel that the place felt a small lack of life given that there are not people living there full time, but some people would consider that a plus. We personally like meeting with the hosts and talking to them about the area, their favorite spots to eat, etc. \n\nFWIW Sea to Sky had all this information available, and the check in was very straight forward. Location was great and the areas to relax were awesome, especially the backyard and the front porch. \n\nThanks!"

While this was not a problem for us at all, I will say that you can hear people walking around upstairs. I only mention this because some people might be bothered by it. We found the place to be perfect in every way, and I would highly recommend it. "

And the rooftop dog walk really helped with late night/early morning doggie visits. Parking wasn't even difficult, due to the paid parking lot next door. Such a bonus for the downtown location.  We really hope to stay here again soon. "

You're welcome up there- and do go check it at sunrise/sunset. One tiny caveat: during a few events their is a resident guest list to get in to the roof. Like during NYE :( Other than that: super awesome!"

We were greeted warmly as we arrived from the airport and shown her spacious 2BR, 2B apartment that was well stocked with soft towels, linens and various bath and kitchen items, including bottled water to take on our daily excursions; Keurig coffee pods and soap tablets for both the clothes and dishwasher.\nHer response to our requests was immediate, including the installation of a curved shower rod for the tub.\nPros:  The newly created apartment had lots of room and privacy for the two of us; having two full baths was much appreciated; the bed was very comfortable; the kitchen was well set up for our breakfasts and a few dinners with excellent appliances; we had use of the gas grill; the supply of good towels was unlimited; there are plenty of lights; the heating system kept us comfortable with different settings possible in each room; we were only occasionally aware of our host living upstairs; the neighborhood is quiet and convenient to many local restaurants as well as to city bus lines.\nCons: basement apartment with limited natural light and limited privacy on one side; kitchen needs small dishes and cups.\nThis was a great place for our month in Seattle and we recommend it highly."

We didn't get to meet either of them, but they did everything to make our stay as welcoming and seamless as possible. There were clean towels and linen, a parking pass for the neighborhood, and even an extra air mattress for the living room. They even left us fancy chocolate :D\n\nWe would highly recommend their home, especially at such a good price. "

The space was a great size for 2 people and it was nice to have the kitchenette as an option while visiting Seattle. Melissa was a very easy host to work with - she allowed us to check in early and was very responsive when we had questions throughout our stay. The one major issue with the apartment that we were not expecting was just outside - when we walked in on the first day, we peeked out the kitchen window into an alley (fine) that was apparently a hot spot for drug use (not fine). Throughout our entire stay, every time we looked out the window people were in the alley partaking in some very hardcore using. It was very unsettling to know that was so close to us and while no one ever bothered us in the neighborhood, it was a major concern. Again, the apartment itself was great and exactly what we were looking for, but my fiance and I agreed the alley view was something that needed to be mentioned."

Beacon Hill has several restaurants, coffee shops and a grocery store within a ten minutes walk of the apartment.\n\nThe apartment is a nicely renovated and pristine two bedroom, one bath in-law unit.  It is comfortable, with all new appliances, including a washer and dryer. Jyoti and her husband were very easy to work with. We would certainly stay here again. "

However, the heat did not work, and it was below freezing outside! Leroy responded by text, offering to pay for a space heater, which we bought, and he did pay for it, in addition to $40 extra. However, the penthouse is really too big to be heated by a space heater, and we never were comfortable, temperature-wise. Additionally, the shower head in the master bathroom was unusable, it hung straight down, next to the wall, with water coming straight down from about the 5 feet level. And finally, there is no window covering in the second bedroom, although the window of the opposing apartment is a mere 15 feet away! I asked Leroy by email if he was going to fix these things, because the location is great for us, but I haven't had a response yet. If he does, I would love to stay here again!"

The apartment is as listed in the pictures. Rates were great in comparison to hotels. \n\nIt's hard for me to be critical because the hosts were very friendly, but I appreciate honest reviews when I'm looking for a place. We were a bit disappointed with the cleanliness: the tub/shower is cramped (clawfoot as indicated) and definitely needed a good scrub. The bedroom and bathroom was very dusty. Trash was full (2 bags) in the bedroom. There was no place for toiletries in the cramped tub or space for luggage/clothing in the room. This was a room and had no B&B feel to it at all. \n\nOverall this felt like a cheap room to crash in; it felt like we were staying in a room someone just stepped out of without preparation for guests. Again location was great as was the host but in the future we would rather pay a little more and rent a hotel or place that felt prepped for guests. "

Street parking was fine.\n\nAll up an excellent B&B location and accommodation option-highly recommended."

The fruit flies mentioned in previous reviews are still around, but kept mostly under control by the scheduled cleanings. The wifi was excellent and the people were all great."

Kitchenette including thoughtful Pike Place brews,  comfortable, cozy sleeping and living spaces, nice outdoor (for warm weather) space as well. Plenty of street parking.

Upon getting settled in we realized that the kitchen was barely useable. There aren't actual cooking utensils to use so my plans to cook one night ended up not happening. The bed is very uncomfortable and the pillows definitely leave much to be desired so bring your own if you're picky. The shower head was extremely low pressure, and the towels in the bathroom were wet when we arrived. There is cable but no HD or DVR services, so that was a letdown as well. The actual building was great and had a nice location...but overall I wouldn't stay here again."

From booking, and all the way past departure; we had a great experience. \n\nCute setup, as the decor was totally fab!  So many of the items, down to the toaster, glassware, tables, chairs, original wood floors - all totally circa 40's-1950 - you really are walking into a historical flashback.\n\nSomething particularly enjoyable (iop) is you're a bit off the \"tech\" grid, if you choose to be. While there's excellent WiFi, you're blessed with no TV, no micro, no need to \"sit around online\" or laze away with Netflix. \n\nCan't say enough about how super amazing Molly and Rob are as hosts. Great hosts always makes a difference. I'll def check their calendar again when back in Seatown..."

There is a boy and this can be serious on weekend. However it is okay to me.\n\nThe problem was parking. there were no street parking space around the house. I turn around house 3 times but could not find. So I parked behind of host's car. but one day other guest parking there and I parked really narrow front yard. When I go out I touched wall and damaged rental car... :(\n\nAnyway it is reasonable to afford cost and I recommend to the guest who is not sensitive on upper sound (Thump and talking sound) and no have a car.\n"

A great book collection if you didn't bring anything to read! And so much cool artwork on the walls! Comfiest pillows ever! Thank you thank you!"

She was mostly prompt with email responses to any questions that I had. However, I do not think that the first word in the title of the apartment can be 'Clean' -- I got this place for my parents and when we all walked in, there were dirty dishes in the sink and the bathroom clearly had not been cleaned for a while. \n\nThe location is great, the price is also good for the location -- my folks liked the bed a lot and slept well, they also felt very safe since the apartment is on the 7th floor. \n\nIf you plan to do any cooking, there are extremely limited cookware supplies - we struggled to find plates, cups and a coffee pot - so I would not plan on eating in.

It was east to access and a great way to see Seattle without the crowds.  \nThey both made us feel so welcome, had wonderful fresh coffee for us each morning & even made us home made banana bread!  \nThey were very helpful,  and gave us space to enjoy our time there.\nWe would stay with them again in a minute-  We loved West Seattle also-  Very quaint and a neat part of the city to explore. \nThanks Carla & Rob for a most enjoyable experience with you!\nKathleen & Mike Shannon  (Shanghai, China)"

I personally love staying at places that are incredibly thoughtful and comfortable. All the little details around the house, from the Nest thermostat, to the OneFortyThree light fixtures to the Rudy's shampoo in the shower culminated in a place that felt like home, in a new neighborhood. \n\nThere was some confusion when we booked but it ended up working out perfectly. Chad was great about calling when we arrived to make sure we had everything and had some great recommendations. I would highly recommend staying here! "

The townhouse is newer construction as you can see in the pictures and it\u2019s very maintained. Martha is on top of things and very easy to communicate with. Her place has central heat but knowing I\u2019m from California she even brought an electric heater in case I got cold at night. I\u2019ll definitely recommend this place to my family and friends."

During our stay we\u2019ve experienced some very bright days as well as rainy and foggy ones and regardless of the weather the views were astonishing. \nThe bed was very comfortable (we only used one bedroom) and the kitchen had everything one might need for cooking, which we did every day. \nThe bathroom is very spacious and the water pressure in the shower is great. I couldn\u2019t resist taking a bath, but if you want to soak in warm water, you need to fill it in several batches, not all at once, otherwise you\u2019ll end up in a cold tub.\nWe had no car, but between car-to-go and the Uber, we had no problem getting around town. Many stores are reachable on foot, so we were comfortable without a car. It\u2019s important to note, that walking in this neighborhood is very pleasant, since there are many beautiful single family homes with gardens.\nDuring our stay, Catherine weren\u2019t in the house, so noises were minimal if any. \nOverall Catherine\u2019s place as well as its location is wonderful and definitely worth a booking.  We will recommend it to our friends and family and would be glad to stay there again ourselves. \n"

The apartment was clean and perfect for our needs. The kitchen is tiny but very well outfitted with dishes, pots and pans and two small fridges - just about everything you could need. Each bedroom has closet and bureau or shelf space available for storage during your stay.  The bedrooms are larger than they appear in the photos. Plenty of towels for guests too. There is a small outdoor patio that is quite nice. In addition we enjoyed sitting in the shade on a large swing. It is a quiet neighborhood- conveniently close to everything in Seattle. There is a supermarket a within a short walking distance. Louise was easily accessible by text to answer any questions. The wifi was not very good, but when we asked, Louise loaned us her hotspot which solved the problem. We would certainly recommend this as a great place to stay. "

She was very hospitable and provided everything that was needed to make my stay comfortable and welcoming. I especially thank her for helping with the cleaning of the studio and keeping the studio clean and tidy.\n\nThe location worked perfectly for me as I had to goto downtown Seattle, South Lake Union area, Amazon campus daily and there were many buses nearby without the need for me transfer. I took either bus #5 or #40, which goes through Ballard and Fremont and to downtown Seattle ( including Pike Place  and Westlake Station).\n\nThere are grocery stores within walking distance, including Safeway and QFC. Neptune coffee is also nearby, a place I highly recommend for a nice cup of coffee.  \n\nOverall, I really enjoyed my stay at Kate's cozy studio and I highly recommend to anyone visiting Seattle."

They were so inviting and were always quick to respond to my many questions. \n\nTheir home is located in West Seattle and is within short walking distance of some great restaurants, of all genres.  The main freeway is also easily accessed from their area, so I had no problem getting to the downtown area within minutes.\n\nThe master suite has a very large and clean private bathroom, as well as an open air balcony on the 3rd floor.  \n\nElaine even made me fresh scones one morning for breakfast.  I would definitely recommend a stay at their home! "

Any future guest can count on being protected by Andy, if help is within his reach, he will do his best.   Andy is a wonderful host. \n\nAndy's place is cozy, beautiful art all around, a comfy bed and fantastic grill in the patio, where we made a few dinners & just chilled.   1 of our favorite bars is Canon, ~5 blocks away, AMAZING location. Plus, Andy has many good movies, action movies... we spent a whole weekend on his sofa doing nothing else than watching movies, rare for us. It was perfect!  Thank you Andy! :)  "

All necessities provided and clean bed, sheets, towels, etc. fast internet. Quick follow up when we called them about key troubles. Very responsive.    It was also very nice that they had a parking spot! (Even if there were strict rules)."

Lots of closet and drawer space as well.  \nAs I came to visit family who live close by, I didn't spend any  real time in the room except for sleeping so it was perfect for my needs.\nLars welcomed me and showed me where everything is located.\nI'm glad I brought my eye mask since the large picture window has no curtains and 1 shoji screen is not enough -- another one would be useful for more privacy.  \nThank you, Lars!"

They are spot on with their airbnb description and the Fremont area is a great place to visit with much culture to absorb. I would recommend any and everyone to stay in this awesome Airstream and great environment. A very clean and kept up property with a nice hang out area and drive way to park in. Never once did we feel uncomfortable or have any complaints what so ever. They have mastered their role as airbnb hosts!"

The apartment is very near to the university of washington. It was clean, has adequate parking and melissa was friendly enough. The not so good thing. The apartment needs a television and some minor maintenance. The kitchen tap handle was detached as was the door handle of the bed room. It was a rather old apartment."

Capitol Hill was a great location- walking distance to food, drinks, shops, parks, busses, bars, etc. You don't need a car and there are lots of people around and things to do. We never really needed to leave the neighborhood aside from sight seeing and then renting a car and to drive out to the mountains. Overall great trip and would definitely stay at Roy's spot again if we come back!"

The location is nice and very close to downtown Seattle. Plus, the area sounds very safe. \n\nPeach prepared a crib for our newborn twins before our late night arrival, which was just absolutely awesome. \n\nWe definitely recomend your home for a short or a long stay, we will also certainly come back !

While I was there professional cleaning services came and did a thorough and much needed job of cleaning the kitchen, bathrooms and living area. The room I was in, which was the larger private one on the second floor, was completely bare bones and quite frankly depressing in appearance, a bed, a rickety tiny desk and a folding chair. Overall, I would say my experience was positive.  "

The unit is clean and the area felt safe staying with a family.\n\nAdvise to all Airbnb renters - communicate with your host.  We had a couple of minor issues that Ren would've resolved immediately had we made him aware. \n\nWe recommend working with Ren if you are looking to stay near UW at a reasonable price."

Almost everything we wanted to see/do was within a mile radius - sightseeing, bars, restaurants. \n\nThe posted pictures aren't of this specific apartment but are a pretty good representation - large windows, contemporary furniture, Pottery Barn color scheme. The balcony faces a public parking lot and does not have an oceanview but you do get a nice view of vintage brick buildings. The beautiful terrace is, however, as pictured and is on the same floor as this apartment. We were here in Nov/Dec so we couldn't enjoy it but next time!\n\nMaster bedroom has an en suite bathroom. The large window was nice but anyone needing absolute darkness or minimal street noise should take the other bedroom. The 2nd bedroom had a tv in it which was a nice bonus."

Left us coffee as a treat.\n\n5) Dog friendly - front yard has decent patch of grass, backyard is closed off (no grass right now in the back). "

My family was greeted with welcome goodies and a well laid out explanation of the rules of the house. \n\nLiz and William left their beautifully decorated Christmas tree and d\u00e9cor up for my family to enjoy. Which my kiddos truly loved! \n\nThe home was spacious and clean.  The house was a little chilly but there is a fireplace in the living room that kept that space cozy. The kitchen had more than enough room and the master bedroom suite is very luxurious. "

Quick to respond and send accurate instructions on how to access her property.\n\nOnly recommendation would be to revise the cleaning fee since it seems a little high!"

The best part was the view from the bed, you could perfectly see the Space Needle! The bed was actually larger than I thought but it was definitely well used and a little slanted toward the middle. Not uncomfortable necessarily but food for thought if you are hoping for a hotel bed. There were cooking accouterments so that we did not have to buy a bunch of additional items to cook for ourselves. In addition, there were soap and body wash left in the bathroom for us to use which was a delightful touch. It was in a quiet location but within a short walk to fun things to do. The skylights in the living room were amazing and negated the need for lights on during the day which I love. Philip was very accommodating with our check out requests and offered us to hang out with him when we returned on our final day which I wish we had the time to do! There were jackets and an umbrella to use which saved me as I could not pack the umbrella I have for the trip. It genuinely felt like we were staying at a friends house and I would not hesitate to stay there again or recommend it to others."

Since Aaron was away, he had a friend check me in who was very friendly and helpful and gave lots of recommendations for places to check out in the area. Also the apartment is in a gated community which gave me extra comfort (not that it would be unnecessary since the neighborhood felt very safe). I would definitely recommend Aaron's place!"

If and when I visit Seattle again, I will be staying here. "

There was no kitchen, but that gave us the excuse to get take out or eat out at all the delicious restaurants nearby (Paseo was our favorite spot, get the Caribbean roast!). Sherill was a wonderful and responsive host and she made the extra effort in accommodating us and our little toddler. We had privacy and was never made to feel uncomfortable or unwelcome, especially with our spirited little daughter. We definitely recommend this place, especially if you're looking for a quiet neighborhood with quick access (by car) to the happening locations."

The house is extremely clean with lovely decor, comfortable furnishings and beds, and a well-stocked kitchen. The listing description is extremely accurate - the home is definitely a \"charming craftsman\".  We especially enjoyed the beautiful backyard outdoor space, a huge flatscreen TV, and a Sonos sound system. My husband and I were traveling with another couple and the house provided both privacy and plenty of room for the 4 of us.\n\nThe neighborhood itself is quiet with friendly neighbors and ample parking. Ballard is a great community, near enough to easily access downtown Seattle, but providing it's own delightful main street shops, restaurants and activities as well.  \n\nAnne and Casey are  thoughtful hosts that truly desire their guests to enjoy their home as if it was their own. Upon request, Anne provided excellent suggestions for restaurants and site-seeing ideas that catered to our preferences and made our visit to Seattle super fun and stress free.  "

Indeed, it was, and she made me feel instantly at home. I reluctantly left my cozy bed early each morning for work, but it was among life's singular pleasures to return each night to the home's portal: a wooden door beneath an arched trellis, illuminated by twinkling faerie lights. Then it was back to that fabulous bedstead into which I snuggled for a night's good rest. Not before reading a chapter or two by the lamp light perched in just the right place. Wonderful details that made my travel a source of refreshment. Many thanks to Carol, her son, and her pup. "

It's just several stops from the airport by taking the Link Light Rail and also several stops to Seattle city center. Very easy to get to and go around even though not staying in the city center. There are also two cats in the apartment. And I just can't stop my love to them cause they are way too cute! Bakery, atm and grocery store are available just 5 mins walking. Though I didn't see Matthew much, he's nice and care-taking during and before my arrival to ensure me having a smooth check-in and stay. So thanks for the accommodation, I had a great time in Seattle and will recommend others to stay there."

It was easy to make ourselves feel at home with its comfortable furnishings, a kitchen with every utensil you'd ever need, a great theater, a lovely backyard and perfect proximity to beautiful Arboretum Park. We've been to Seattle many times as our kids live there, but have always stayed in a hotel. After this wondeful experience, a hotel room will never live up to this special place. This was my first experience with Airbnb and the bar has been set high by Beth! "

The upper suite was awesome for my girlfriend and I, an easy commute downhill to my training location.  Even though I had done research beforehand, Marcel was exceptionally helpful in locating/giving clear directions to great shopping, walking areas in West Seattle.  My girlfriend enjoyed shopping & walking in the West Seattle areas, as well as enjoying just 'chilling' in the comfortable suite, while I attended my training days.  I would definitely recommend this quiet getaway location to others seeking a close vicinity to, but not in downtown Seattle. "

We didn't meet her, but she was available for any questions via phone/text.  When we arrived, we were a little confused as to how to get to her apartment., but that's because I did not see her email with the instructions. For me it was a challenge as it does not have an elevator, and the apartment is on the 3rd floor. But, by the second day it was fine and I got better at minimizing the trips by being more organized and not forgetting things in the apartment or the car.\n\nThe location is very convenient, and once acclimated I was very comfortable in the neighborhood. Quite a few interesting sites within walking distance - Bruce Lee's gravesite is about 6 blocks away and it's in a beautiful park that includes a museum, lake & just a very peaceful and calming environment.  Bakery Nouveau is a 7 minute walk (5 for most people), and is to die for.  Many restaurant to choose from.  We had a car and it seemed like everyplace was only a 5-20 minute drive.  I found it to be very convenient.\n\nWe had 6 for Thanksgiving dinner, and it was a bit of challenge in terms of pots and pans, but we made do and we had a wonderful meal.  There should be plenty of space for 4 people for a short stay. Bed's were comfortable and the whole home was warm & cozy. The furnishing was quaint, so if you're expecting a 5 star hotel,  this is not the place. \n\nI would choose this place anyday over a cramped hotel. I would not hesitate to recommend this place if your looking to visit Seattle."

She is very close to public transportation which was a huge plus for us since we did have a car. She even offered to pick us up from the light rail on our first night so we wouldn't have to drag our luggage in the rain. She was very easy to communicate with and we texted back and forth several times throughout our stay. \nThis was my first experience with Airbnb, and Julie did a wonderful job making me feel comfortable and excited about using the service in the future.

The location was accessible enough with public transportation, and Lyft/Uber made things way easier come the late hours. When we arrived, we simply punched in a door code which made everything so simple. Also, the fridge came stocked with two beers, some sodas, and waters, not to mention a Keurig which was free for us to use. Ken was extremely accommodating via text, and made sure to provide recommendations if we needed them. "

Although we did not have much interaction with Marcia (due to conflicting schedules), instructions to her house and for accessing the room and facilities were perfect. Marcia's house is warm and welcoming and the room is amply large, clean, and includes a private bathroom. This is one of the most comfortable beds we've ever slept in and combined with the super-quiet neighborhood, we had three peaceful and restful nights. Very convenient to all that the wonderful Ballard neighborhood has to offer (including some of Seattles best bakeries). We barely used our car as everything is walking distance. A fantastic experience. Highly recommended."

        "comments": "Both Claire and Michael are very friendly, and their dog Franklin was sweet.\n     The house is beautiful in a convenient location only a block from my son\u2019s home in the Wallingford neighborhood. The area is wonderful, lots of shops, restaurants and parks, and a great place to go on walks.  The bedroom was spacious, and the bed was very nice and comfortable, with a firm mattress. Because I was spending my waking time with my family, I was only sleeping and showering there, so I wanted a clean and quiet place to spend three nights. \n     There did turn out to be a few problems. The first was when I arrived at the agreed upon time (8:00 \u2013 8:30pm) the first evening.  Nobody answered the doorbell or phone, so I left after waiting 40 minutes, returned later that night a second time with still no answer at the door, and finally ended up on my son\u2019s couch the because it was late and I was tired.  The next night, Claire apologized sincerely and I was able to stay for two nights instead of three.\n     The other two issues were the cleanliness and noise levels.  I\u2019ve hostelled quite a bit, so I am used to sharing bathrooms, but I thought the bathroom was not acceptably clean.  In addition, there were times during the night and early mornings when it was very noisy in the house. I think the noise was due in part to someone arriving home late at night, and getting up early in the morning and just not being quiet. And some was attributable to Franklin running around and getting into things like the garbage in the metal step-can in the bathroom adjacent to my room (very loud), and jumping into piles of packing paper and other things lying on the floor in a room across from me in the early morning. After two nights of too little sleep, I left there very tired because of the noise both late each night and early each morning.\n"

So, the location was absolutely perfect. \n\nThe apartment looks even better in person than in the photos. Plenty of space for my brother and I (he got the bed, I took the couch, which was fine by me). The bathroom was beautiful and the decorations made the entire space feel welcoming. I hope that if (when) we come back to Seattle, we get a chance to stay here again!"

While not totally under the host's control, this did make for some loud mornings.\n\nThere is something of a dearth of space in the kitchen, but it was never super problematic.\n\nMelissa was very easy to communicate with, responded very quickly and was very respectful and pleasant.

Getting checked in was a little rocky (the host isn't actually the person giving you the keys, they have a staff member do that. The staff member was at a different entrance than the one we were told to go to, so we were playing Marco Polo for a bit). Apartment is clean, more than enough room for 4 people, free parking, cute balcony, pool etc. I also love that they left us free snacks to eat! Only complaint is that they asked us to take out the trash and wash the linens before checkout (even though we paid a $96 cleaning fee when booking the room). Thanks for hosting us Darik!"

Since we use to live in Seattle we didn't need much help, but Peter was available if necessary. All the previous reviews were spot on. We have stayed in a number of Airbnb properties in Seattle and this is by far the nicest. In the future it will be our first choice. We were here during a nasty storm and when were out it was warm and inviting to come back to. Lots of great amenities so all you need is your toothbrush. Thank you Miarian and Peter. Look forward to meeting you Marian next time we are in town."

Diana was accommodating throughout our trip, providing breakfast items, including eggs from her chickens, and checking in to answer any questions we had about the city. Overall, the process was easy and really contributed to a great trip.  "

The room could be a little crowed for a party of two, however we managed to create more walking space when we put our luggage into the closet. The room is also equipped with a monitor which is cable enabled and also connected to Roku TV, although we did not have the opportunity to turn it on.\n\nDaisy has tried her best to make her guests' trip and stay easy. For traveling, she has prepared a whole set of informative materials covering the local good eats, travel tips in Seattle as well as transportation guides. For navigating throughout the apartment, she has considerately labeled many items/areas to prevent guests from confusion.\n\nFor the neighborhood, it's perfect for us: it's close to downtown Seattle (~15 min driving); it's very quite at night (suburban area), and there are lots of parking around. We have not explored nearby, but we did have great experiences with a couple of local restaurants/cafes."

The location is in a quiet residential space, close to the delicious Ballard district, and easy to get to. We were driving to Vancouver the next day so being north of the city was an ideal location. Plus, it's close to Discovery Park, which has great trails and a running path along the beach. We got to briefly meet Sean, and he was really friendly and even made us tea in the morning. If you're looking for an easy stay in Seattle, definitely recommended!"

There were fresh flowers on the coffee table, ground coffee and filters in the kitchen, and nice touches throughout the entire place that made it a great experience.  If you are sensitive to noise at all, you might be chagrined by the music playing until 2am in the bar directly below.  However, earplugs are provided and we both thought of it as part of the novelty of staying downtown. Sadly, we had to leave early due to a family emergency, but it was lovely while it lasted."

We were in town one weekend for a drumming festival that was at different locations throughout the city and this made for a great home base between all activities. There is a fantastic 24 hr market a couple blocks down, as well as superb brunch spots (Talouse, 5-Spot), etc. \n\nThanks Maria for providing such a neat, sweet place --- we left having thoroughly enjoyed the true \"Seattle\" experience everyone is after."

We will certainly keep in touch when back in the area!  Many thanks!"

The house is centrally located, but ensure you mention Martin King Luther Jr Way SOUTH. There are two such ways.\nAs the room was not cleaned for our benefit we expect a refund of the cleaning fee of $44.00. Plus as there was no breakfast provided, we expect a refund of $12.50 per person per night allowance for the duration of our stay. We have accepted no clean towels on the first night as a mistake on our behalf. The refund we expect is (phone number hidden)."

Great views of the city from the upper levels. Buses nearby to get you downtown. Bikes on the lower level are free to use .. which is really perfect given the waterfront trail in front of the house which acts as a major artery between U of W and business campuses such as Google. During the day the house is very quiet.. most will be at work. At night you can socialize with other hackers or listen to one of the talks.  A lot of the guests are fairly long term (several months) so you can also get great advice on the city. The 4 person room lifestyle is not for everyone. Indeed, the house is in need of a few repairs which I believe are soon to be made.  But I wouldn't say that any of this made me uncomfortable. I really recommend this place for anyone working in tech new to the Seattle area."

It's actually the cleanest Airbnb place we've stayed in so far (this is our 4th) and I believe it's because Wendy personally makes sure the place is clean.  Other Airbnb places rely on outside cleaning services and without direct owner oversight, it's never really that clean.  We had everything that we needed.  We debated whether we should've gotten a rental car before arriving, but the public transportation from the apartment was super easy.  The bus stops were less than two blocks away and they took us everywhere we needed to go in every direction.  Most places we went to didn't even require a transfer.  Getting to this apartment via public transportation from the airport was also super easy; it was just one light rail ride plus one bus ride.  The only minor downside was that the internet and Netflix connection was spotty at times.  Thank you Wendy!  "

It\u2019s well built and cozy on chilly nights, and the hot tub is only a few steps outside the door.  The neighborhood has some funky, fun restaurants and a small-town feel, even though it\u2019s only a short drive from downtown.

        "comments": "Well, this outside picture of the house is much nicer than it really is. No maintenance is performed on the outside whatsoever. The landscaping is in disarray. The railings to the stairs are falling apart and rotting. This was a big safety issue for one of our party. Also, there are no written instructions about garbage removal, etc. There is a tiny garbage can outside plus other bins that other stuff goes in. It was confusing. We were there for a week(party of 6) and it did become somewhat of an issue. The kitchen looks like a remodel not done very well. Some of the kitchen drawers are very hard to open because cabinets don't fit well in the space. There is a gas pipe that goes to the stove sticking out from under the cabinet of the island. Unattractive and possibly a safety hazard. The kitchen sink leaks and this was extremely inconvenient as we had to put towels underneath the sink to keep water from getting onto the floor. We couldn't find an actual drip. So I don't know what's going on with that. The bedrooms were nice but the toilet seat in the Jack and Jill bathroom slides around and needs replaced. No problems with the upstairs bedroom. Also, there is a living room couch with a pull out bed but there is a heavy marble coffee table that has to be moved in order to use it. Not a great setup or bed actually. We ended up not using the bed after pulling it out and seeing the condition it was in. Finally, written instructions on connecting to the wireless would have been nice. Things like which network it is, the password etc.  We aren't all tech savvy. We did eventually figure it out. So all in all just ok and overpriced for what you get. We were especially disappointed that there is no usable outside space. The summer is so nice and we really missed just being able to sit outside. "

We didn't have to arrange a time to meet with the owners, and could check-in anytime during the day, which was very convenient. \n\nThe home was located at a small street in a older neighborhood that has seen better times. We arrived in the evening, and it was a little difficult navigating through dark streets. However, during our stay, we didn't experience any issues with the neighbors.\n\nThe entrance to the driveway is pretty narrow and steep, so vehicles with lower ground clearance should proceed with caution. There were 2 parking spaces inside the garage and a large drive way that can fit 2 or 3 more cars, which was great because we had 3 cars.\n\nThe house was clean and tidy. Two rooms up stairs with 3 beds, and 1 bedroom downstairs with 2 more beds. It was a tidy but old home, and the home really shows its age. There were many little things here and there that needs to be fixed up. Two out of the three room's window/bug screen were missing, and the screens in the dinning area + washroom had holes in it. The dishwasher was not functioning, and there was yellow water pooling at the bottom. It was fine when we closed it, but it smelled pretty bad when we first opened it.\n\nIt was great value for the distance from downtown Seattle considering the general cost of the area. There was nothing that happened during our stay where we needed to contact Kim. Overall, we were satisfied with our stay."

Ann was a gracious hostess providing us with healthful snacks and a well equipped studio.   Her house is located across the street from an elementary school up a big hill.  You  needed  to walk up 14 steps to reach her house and then down 14 steps to reach the lower level of her house.  The studio is  spacious with a separate kitchenette area.  The bed is against two walls so getting in and out requires a bit of crawling.  Closet space under the stairs is limited. There is a small mini market down the hill as well as a nice local coffee shop. The Montlake area is very close to downtown.  We took a Uber to the space needle and it was around $14.  There is also a bus at the end of the street.  Seattle is lovely and a great city for billy goats as it is very very hilly.  Thanks Ann for your hospitality... We'll be back.   Marlene B.\n"

Awesome!\nZachariah was really welcoming.  He was very understanding of our lateness  due to unexpected traffic .   He was very gracious, offering to help us and he stuck around to make sure that we felt comfortable in the space.   He encouraged us to use anything that was there, which made us feel even more at ease, and the apartment was very well equipt with amenities beyond just the \"basics.\"\n The apartment itself was very nicely laid out ,  A literal hop skip and a jump from the pool  and workout facilities .  Located in the heart of it all you might expect it to be louder than it was, but it was actually quite peaceful in the apartment.  It was also clean and well furnished.  The double leather couches were super comfy!  We had 3 adults and 1 child stay there, and there was ample space.\nWe were very happy with our stay!"

It was perfect for our long term stay, with all of the amenities listed.  We especially appreciated the dishes and cooking utensils provided in the kitchen, so we were able to cook throughout our stay.  The bed was very comfortable and the space was ample for two people.  We brought two cars and appreciated being able to park on the street in front of the house for free.  The neighborhood is quiet and safe.  It is near many local restaurants and University Village shopping district, which we enjoyed visiting.  There are multiple grocery stores within a short driving distance.  Linda was present when we checked in and was always available when we had questions or needed anything.  She was very kind and helpful to us.  We were very pleased with everything throughout our stay and would recommend this apartment to anyone, whether you are planning a short trip or a long term stay."

        "comments": "Our experience overall was very good, and I would definitely recommend this apartment. My husband, daughter and I stayed here for one week over Labor Day weekend. The friendly neighborhood was perfect for us. It is only a few blocks to Green Lake Park, and 5 or 10 minutes walking in just about any direction will get you to shops (and a grocery), great restaurants and coffee. It is all new inside and very comfortable.\n\nJim seemed like a caring host. We were on our own for a couple of hours after we arrived because we couldn't get in. He was on his way to L.A. when we tried to call, but as soon as Jim got our message he was very apologetic and helpful getting us in and set up. There had apparently been some confusion between him and his daughter, and she had sent us to the wrong door.\n\nI continued to wonder if we were in the right place, though, because there was no welcome message, set of instructions, recommendations nor information about the area for us. There was, however, the realtor's welcome for new home owners (deed, description of property, etc.)\n\nJim said it was the first time the apartment had been rented. It is newly renovated with new floors, windows, painting and comfortable furniture. We enjoyed the comfortable living room and dining room, especially. It is sunny and spacious.\n\nThere were some other weird furnishings that may have been start-up glitches. For example, there was no microwave, dish soap nor sponge, dishcloth or dish towel. No hangers. It just didn't feel ready for us.\n\nI think these were all start-up glitches, and they weren't major problems. I do recommend this upper Green Lake apartment for a comfortable stay in a great location. \n\nOh - a note about parking: as in all of Wallingford, the smaller the car the better, because the streets have cars parked on both sides so they are essentially one-lane wide."

From the apartment it is a just a short walk to the beach (great for a brisk morning swim) and Madison Street where there is a nice little grocery and a number of restaurants & bars. I recommend the Madison Park Bakery for coffee and baked goods and highly recommend Independent Pizza for lunch or dinner. The 11 bus is also right there, we had no trouble navigating the city without a car. I would definitely stay here again."

The house itself is beautiful with lots of great aesthetic touches. \nThere is ONLY ONE shower (which we were not informed of before our stay), so be prepared if you come with a larger group.\nWe all struggled a bit with the lack of window treatments, and the numerous church bells. It was quite noisy and bright, so after our first night, we ventured out for earplugs and eye masks. Come prepared!\nThe place also doesn't seem to have wifi; at least I never heard yay or nay from Sheeba. We were able to \"steal\" some from the neighborhood (#junctionlife), but it was spotty and unreliable. It would have been nice to have wifi in the home. "

Communication  with Roberta and Pat before we checked in was a breeze. After meeting us at check-in they gave us a brief tour and offered to help us in any way during our stay if needed.  Things like coffee, cream and sugar, so you didn't have to rush to the store right away, a bathroom with plenty of plush towels and full bottles of shampoo, cream rinse and soap, along with a couple of dryers, magnifying mirror and a wonderful shower head (that we all commented on), were just a few of the special touches that this Airbnb had to offer. Not to mention the fact that the location couldn't have better. We rented a car, but it isn't really necessary if you are just there to enjoy the city and close surrounding areas.  We would highly recommend this rental to anyone who wants a place that you look forward to returning to at the end of a long day, or even staying in for a day during your visit to relax. It was just perfect. \n"

Countless amazing restaurants, coffee shops and bars (breweries too), are just a few blocks away. Brent welcomed me in person, did a walk through and gave me great recommendations for dinner and breakfast. During the trip he communicated frequently and gave me a pro tip on how to run to Green Lake (thanks!). I've already recommended Brent's airbnb to my colleagues who travel to Seattle frequently for work.   "

I did not have a car, and so I found plenty of cool shops and eateries within a few blocks or a short bus ride away - the bus stop is very close and convenient. I was in Seattle to complete some school assignments, so I found the room a perfect place to study and unwind from my busy days. It was very quiet. Stephen and Cindy were willing to accommodate my request to check in and out a little earlier than usual, and when I met Stephen, he was friendly, helpful, and made me feel comfortable immediately. Everything about the room was clean, neat, and orderly. It all looked new and fresh, waiting just for me. I loved peeking out into the garden, although it was too chilly to enjoy sitting outside! The private entrance meant I could come and go without disturbing anyone, and really helped me feel at home. I would definitely recommend the room as a cozy and comfortable home away from home when visiting Seattle!"

Joy's garden was such a joy for my family to walk around, my father sat for hours, admiring the beautiful Seattle skyline while enjoying his cup of tea. All in all, it was a very satisfying experience for my whole family and it was the perfect location to get to anywhere with bus stops dotted around the neighborhood. "

After browsing a few other listings, I definitely didn't want to be restricted with entry/exit hours nor share bathrooms. Michael's room is the PERFECT setup if you're looking for privacy! You have the entire first level to yourselves with a private, full bathroom and even a private door leading to the backyard (perfect for smoking). There is a heating system as well as TV. It only took us 10-15 minutes to get downtown- super convenient since we made several trips out there everyday. Abundant street parking in neighborhood. A bit confusing to find at first (it's behind another townhouse on the street) but my boyfriend and I loved being able to come/go as we pleased. We didn't get a chance to chat with Michael too much, as he was busy with work and we were busy exploring the city- but I wouldn't have it any other way! Michael's home was clean, cozy, and convenient! Would absolutely stay here again the next time we visit Seattle!"

While there were several options in the surrounding area, Michaels location was perfect. The space was located just a minute walk from the main shops, but you felt as though you had privacy if desired. A multitude of boutiques and cafes fulfilled any want or wish. The BNB's main level location with private access was perched above the city street. Michael's space was decorated and appointed with unique, comfortable furniture. Everything you could desire is there; Full bath, kitchen, dining nook and a walk-in closet allowing a guest to fully unpack and relax. Since the party was not until 8:00 PM I had some time to kill. While exploring the Hill was tempting, I felt most at ease and relaxed taking 2-3 hours in the space with a glass of wine. A nap?, yes that happened. I will definitely be booking again with Michael!"

My only regret is that we didn't get to linger longer in the apartment!  It was cozy and warm, and perfect.

He is a great host, and the bedroom was just as described with a comfortable bed, large desk, and walk-in closet. The house is large with lots of common space, but generally very quiet.  The kitchen was well equipped for the light cooking I did. Parking was easy, and getting to/from downtown isn't too bad by car or bus, just remember rush hour traffic can be brutal.\n\n\nNeil was prompt with communication before/during my stay and was very helpful when I needed to modify my reservation dates. Overall I would definitely recommend Neil and his house to guests looking for a relaxed and quiet place to stay"

It never took more than a few min to hear back from him. \n- The neighborhood is great -- lots within walking distance to explore. - The place itself was really nice and cozy with a nice kitchen + things to cook/eat with. Plenty of space for 2 or more people. Extra sheets + blankets were provided for the sofa bed.\n\nCons: \n-The rest of the building is being remodeled, so there was sometimes construction noise, including at some pretty odd times (up until 10pm on a Saturday night). It was never really loud enough to wake you up, but was a bit odd given the timing. \n- The main heating vent is in the bedroom, so that gets pretty warm while the rest of the unit can be a bit chilly.\n- Sofa bed is pretty old, and was hard to pull in and out. Not the most comfortable to sleep on.\n\n"

The space was amazing... Valarie has created a modern space with decor and dishes that were perfect for our occasion. We had hoped to utilize the rooftop but it happened to be too windy for our Moroccan themed tent... So we moved it indoors with a bit of shifting of furniture :) it worked out just fine. Valarie on each stay was available to meet a few requests with early check-in and extra dishes on the second visit for the studio. The only hiccup was needing some backup restock for TP that had been overlooked by the cleaning crew. She was gracious in her apologies on the oversight and made herself available for any need we might have going forward. I adore this space and will keep it at the forefront for further occasions we might plan as the Ballard community is a great place to stay in for all the delicious restaurants and shops therein! The townhouse does have extremely steep staircases so it may be a problem for anyone needing handicap access to upper levels, but the downstairs studio off the Main Street seems like it might work for a stay that does not require a kitchen and the bathroom is a large space and the shower is big and open. Valarie mentioned she may have some new Airbnb spaces opening in Feb... I will definitely keep an eye out for those as well! "

The house was clean and comfortable, and my family felt spoiled by the newly remodeled spa bath (and heated floors in all bathrooms!). Plenty of space, and comfy beds. The family took many walks around the neighborhood, for fun and exercise, and also for nearby coffee and Top Pot doughnuts. A great experience, and we wouldn't hesitate to book the house again. WAY better (and less expensive) than the hotel we have used in the past."

She was very friendly and helpful with providing basic directions to get around the area, and the place is a fairly close distance to both Ballard and Downtown, about a $10 uber ride either direction and a close by bus stop. I would stay here again for sure, it was a cute room for a great price! "

The neighborhood is central to everything, has several good eating/coffee/bar options, and is very accessible by public transport/car/bike. (However, if you are looking to stay in a quaint Seattle neighborhood, this is probably not it.) The apartment was clean, comfortable, quiet. The best part - the decks are huge with great views!"

We ended up getting our quota of sleep and hopefully the rest of the journey will proceed as planned. I will keep Brent on my contact list for future benefits."

We stayed for 4 days and didn't want to leave.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Tall above the hustle and bustle of the city you'll find this centrally-located and cleanly apartment in the Harbor Steps. It is so centrally located in Downtown on 1st and Western, that we were able to walk anywhere in downtown with ease. We walked to the Sculpture Park, SafeCo Field, the Space Needle, the Living Computer Museum, Columbia Tower and MORE. This place is the center of every great restaurant and bar in Seattle, too.\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 The apartment is complete with a large TV, which we enjoyed Christmas music from during our mornings with cups of coffee. Although we spent the majority of our time touring Seattle by foot, this place was an amazing place to rest our heads before beginning our next venture in the city the following day.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 The bathroom is so clean and accommodating. There is a washer and dryer in the unit, which helps when you need to dry your coat after being rained-on.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0We didn't do much cooking, but the kitchen is full and complete with utensils, cups, and an oven/dishwasher/fridge of course. The fridge came in handy for storing our local beers we picked up. :)\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Overall, the classy and clean place is outstanding! Don't miss the opportunity to stay here if you can. The location makes it all worth while, and the comfortable and clean nature of the apartment makes it even harder to leave!"

It's true, they had just moved in and a few things were getting arranged during my stay, but they always took care that everything was fine for me. The location is really great, just between the space needle and Pike Place (5 min to either of them), and the apartment is big, fresh, and with an amazing terrace with priceless views. Also, very reasonably priced, when compared to other airBnB listings and hotel prices in Seattle. Moreover, Andrew and Shawna are very cool and nice to talk to, and attentive in case of any need. The only thing that bugged me a little bit was that the internet connection in the room was quite slow, sometimes not working, but I am sure that they will fix this soon. I totally recommend this place to stay during a visit to Seattle."

I also enjoyed the walk to PCC and to the lite rail. \n\nThe space was very comfortable. The accommodation was spacious. good bathroom, comfortable couch in the sitting room and the bed room was comfortable. And there was good light for reading. \n\nMy only difficulty was there was no wifi.  Next time I will bring my laptop so I can connect to their internet. \n\nThank you, \n\nSusan"

If you want a warm, homey place to stay at in an incredible location near Capitol Hill book it now! Plus they are also dog friendly."

It is also within realistic walking distance to downtown, but honestly we never walked the trek because the bus is just so easy (and it was winter and slightly drizzly and cool).\n\nThe apartment is adorable and charming and Joe far exceeded my expectations for a host. He was easy to contact for any questions, gave us some great locals tips for the neighborhood, and offered ideas for what to do on off-weather days. The apartment had tons of great resources for what to do and how to get there in Seattle, everything is labelled and accessible (love that they posted the WiFi password on the wall), and we loved that they had the most up to date copy of the Stranger waiting for us! That's how we found out about an awesome bluegrass evening in Fremont. As always we just wish we had more time to spend there. It would have been the perfect place to curl up and read a bit, but we were always on the go.  I'm considering returning to the \"charming oasis\" for a February trip. Couldn't have asked for more."

The cottage was clean, well maintained and very well stocked with dishes, kitchen items, linens, bedding, etc.  My husband loved the music docking station (for his iphone).  April and Mike are easy owners and were helpful when needed.  The location of the cottage is also convenient...a short drive into Seattle or north to the Edmonds area.  The queen bed in the master bedroom was comfortable!  That's important.  "

This led me scrambling to find alternate housing for me and three of my friends and I was incredibly fortunate to stumble across Tina.\n \nIt wasn\u2019t remotely close to the other location my friends were staying downtown but it was in a lovely neighborhood we had stayed in before via AirBnB.  Fortunately, we had rented a car, but Tina\u2019s house was a brief walk (~ 1 block) to a bus line that could have taken us to and from the Seattle convention center easily.  We also used Uber a couple of nights that some of us stayed out late and the fees weren\u2019t unreasonable so that\u2019s another option as well if you don\u2019t have your own transportation.\n \nThere were issues with AirBnB\u2019s website in trying to get the space booked, but Tina was very helpful and forthcoming with the process as she did her best to accommodate my request, which eventually went through.\n \nAs for the space itself, she has a lovely house that we all thoroughly enjoyed staying in.  My three friends (1 couple, 1 single) stayed upstairs and shared a bathroom while I stayed in the basement and got my own.  \n \nI also agreed to let their cat, Lyric, stay in the house with us though boarding her was an option.  While we were happy to have her stay, it is important to note that if you choose to do so you need to feed her twice a day (8am and 6pm was suggested), though you don\u2019t need to worry about the litterbox.  She is a VERY friendly cat and she\u2019ll want spend lots of time with you including sleeping with you, so if you are staying in the basement expect to be visited by her during the night.  Also, she has a habit of sprinting around the house around 6-7am in the morning, so if you\u2019re a light sleeper I recommend one of the bedrooms upstairs with a door. :D\n \nAll in all, it was a lovely trip and I would absolutely recommend Tina to anyone traveling to Seattle who was their own transportation or doesn\u2019t mind riding the bus or using cabs.

The location of this place is pretty good. 15-20 min walk to three distinct neighborhoods and right on the bike trail as well.\n\nI'd recommend asking about the renovation status and plans before booking. Most folks left for the day but I work from home. The noise and disruption from the renovation project made that impossible. Fortunately, the team was very accommodating and moved me to the Capitol Hill location with no problem.\n\nI really enjoyed getting to know the other folks in the house. If you're trying to network and learn about interesting projects happening in Seattle, the people will make up for the minor inconveniences of the house."

Her room is full of lovely plants and charming decor.

Just takes a keen eye and a little patience."

We were impressed with her commitment to the environment and green living though the compostable toilet was a bit of a challenge for me It is also very accessible to town though in a quiet neighborhood which was comforting after the rush of the city.

People were friendly and welcoming, and there was a genuine feeling of community amongst the residents.\n\nNow for the bad:\n\nFirst of all I must state that it seems I stayed at the place when lots of renovation was happening. I'm hoping this is not the norm, so your mileage may vary...\nI was in a 2 person room on the bottom floor. The shower was being renovated (thus non-existing), so the closest shower was one floor up, shared by the residents of both floors. The renovations were not stated in the listing.\nMy room was adjacent to the work, thus it was impossible to sleep in, since noisy construction started early in the morning. The construction noise also meant that most people preferred to leave the house in order to get some work done. In the room there was an exposed water pipe, and very loud dripping noise started every time that pipe was used. The room had no \"luxuries\" like a hook to hang my wet towel on.\n\nDuring my stay the entire house lost water for two days. Walking 20 minutes in the morning (to my workplace) just to brush my teeth and take a shower was not a pleasant experience. I can see how this sort of thing can happen, and the host was very gracious about it, trying to find solutions for the residents. Normally I would not comment about such an unforeseen event, but along with the rest of the renovation, this was a bit too much. We were promised a refund for the 2 days, I'm still waiting for mine.\n\nI can see how this place can be great if no renovation is taking place. I think the host should have either shut-down during the renovation, or at least make it explicit in the listing.\n\nGiving it 3 starts, as an average between my 1 star experience and the 5 starts it could have been.\n\nWhen I left, they just started tearing apart the upstairs kitchen..."

Since this is our first airbnb experience, I was cautious in my expectations.  However, I really appreciated having the space of the apartment (compared to a hotel room).  The neighborhood was perfect for us - easy to walk, easy to park, and close to our daughter in Wallingford.  The only drawback for us was the street noise (just cars driving by) from the bedroom, but once we acclimated that was not a problem. Josh's place is a  lovely home away from home."

Kim hand drew a map of places to check out in the neighborhood which helped make my stay in Seattle much more authentic.    They both generously opened their place up to my friends and I and made us feel like we were at home.  They also made themselves available to me if I needed anything, or had any questions.  If I could give them more than a 5 star rating I would, I couldn't recommend better hosts and a better space.  Thank you very much Ken and Kim :)"

The bed was comfy and we had a private bathroom to ourselves down the hall. As an additional bonus, we were able to use the hot tub in the backyard, which was such a great way to end a busy day of travelling or sightseeing! Overall, we had a great stay in this guest room. Couldn't have asked for a better first AirBnB experience! "

The house is on a very high hill, with no store in sight.  It was particularly a problem for us, having traveled by plane across country.  Fortunately I brought a couple granola bars for us to have until our adult children could come to get us.  It was rather precarious to climb up a some stone steps and over an old wooden deck to get to the second floor entrance.  It was really tricky for my husband, who was wearing a cast on his foot. There was not railing all of the way.\n   As we were isolated, there was only a computer to use, which helped.\n   (No TV!!!)  When seated on the couch in the living room, there was just a baby grand piano and an African drum to view.  Since there was a 9 month old baby downstairs, I wasn't inclined to play the piano.\n  The entertainment center in the bedroom had a wooden bar and hangers!\n    The sheets were leftover from a camp(old and worn) and the rugs in the bathroom needed to be washed. \n   Since there was only one washcloth provided, my husband got it as he washed up first.\n   It was very isolating and we were very frustrated by the situation."

He left us bottled water, chocolate, cookies and a bottle of wine, and invited us to help ourselves to anything we wanted from his fridge and cupboards! His place was just as described and has wonderful views over Lake Union. It is only a 5 minute drive to the Space Needle, Space Museum, Chihuly Gardens, and a host of other places in the central part of Seattle. He has a very spacious bedroom, nice living room with big TV, and a washer and dryer, which is always handy when you are travelling. My only reservation was that I found his kitchen and bathroom counters quite cluttered, because he left out all his small appliances and protein powders in the kitchen, and his own toiletries in the bathroom. Aside from that, I think this place would be perfect for any 30-something's who want a handy base from which to explore Seattle for a few days."

The apartment was a little cozy, but there was plenty of room for the 2 of us. \nI would definitely recommend a stay here to anyone looking to avoid the bustle of the downtown core.\nThanks for a great trip, Iulia!"

Their home is wonderful and the neighborhood was perfect; they gave us lots of suggestions on what to do, where to go, what to eat, etc. Our (almost) 3 year old loved it, and we have never had such a nice time in any hotel with him before. The park next to their building was great to run around in too (helped our son burn off that extra energy from the time change!). It was very easy to catch a bus to the EMP, Pike Place, and Miners Landing from there. We would recommend that anyone with small children stay here if they want to avoid hotels and get a real feel for the city. "

The house worked well for all of us.  It is very \"homey\" and comfortable.  Roger had warned us of the one issue for little ones -- an open stair case off the living room -- and the children quickly learned the rule to stay by the wall when going up and down.  Because it was so cold we were not able to take advantage of the wonderful outdoor area but had spectacular views of the lake and the changing weather over it (including from the upstairs bath and shower!)  House was very easy for a family to be in and it was easy to cook for and feed six adults when the whole family congregated for Thanksgiving dinner and other meals.  Roger also was extremely responsive when we had questions and did just the right amount of checking in with us.   As others have noted, the location is great -- easy drives to both the airport and downtown; very quiet neighborhood; children can walk to the local park.  We are hoping for a return visit one summer to take advantage of the great lake access.  "

The room is like 5 stars hotel, beautifully decorated and fully equipped, especially the bathroom, so bright and clean. We never stayed in such a clean and tidy bathroom. Matt and Amanda's hospitality and fantastic house will definitely be the reason we will come back to visit Seattle again! "

I actually fell sick during my stay with her and she even helped me get better.\n\nThe apt. is small, two bedrooms. The bedroom we stayed in had two beds, a desk and a closet, with enough space for both of us to hang our stuff in. The beds were comfortable and Sofwa even provided us with towels for the bathroom. \n\nIt is really easy to get to her place and a bus stop is a minute down the road. I would stay with Sofwa anytime again!"

The \"space needle\" basement entertainment room is a great space to lounge, watch sports in surround sound, read by the fire, or even work out.  It's also super convenient to have the bathroom and laundry room right outside the bedroom.  \n\nAlex is a nice host.  He gives you privacy if you want it, but is also someone to have a quick chat with at breakfast, etc. \n\nAlthough there were other guests in the house when I was there, it was still comfortable and quiet.  Everyone respects the house and facilities.  \n\nThe location is walkable to \"the strip\" in Queen Anne so it's easy to grab groceries, or get dinner/drinks and not have to drive.  The neighborhood is very safe and quiet and it's super nice to have free parking on the street.  "

The location is ideal -- walking distance to great coffee shops, bars, and restaurants, and not far from other fun neighborhoods and downtown Seattle itself. If you like running (or walking), this is a great starting point to explore the city (Green Lake, Gas Works Park, UW Botanic Gardens, etc). The house itself was also lovely, everything was very clean, and the beds were super comfortable. "

Since the house is also near the Pike Place market, it is very convenient as well. \n      The community is very quiet and I spent the first Christmas here in the United States with my parents. Simon\u2019s house has a fantastic kitchen, with every kind of kitchen wares, spices. My mom cooked a hearty Chinese meal, giving me a sense of staying back at my home in Beijing. Whenever we encountered problems, Laisa was always available for help. Staying at their house proves to be comfortable and free. My whole family love Simon\u2019s house a lot. \n"

It's difficult to walk more than 3 blocks in any direction without comping upon a coffee house, bakery, trattoria, bar or some wonderful little restaurant.

Fortunately Felix had hidden keys in a couple locations so, with Felix's directions via cell phone, we were able to get in.  The best thing for us was the location in Ballard.  The room was small and clean with an attached private bath.  The bed was a low profile  design so there was no place for two people to set down and have a conversation in the room.  Usually there was on street parking available within 1 block of Felix's place.   "

Christmas in Portland caused our trip to be delayed by several hours so we weren't able to check in until around 9pm on Christmas day.  The house was clean and charming and well represented by the pictures we found on Airbnb.  We hadn't fully thought things out regarding food and found ourselves at the house on Christmas in the evening without any food.  We found some food in the fridge and made quesadillas from some tortillas and cheese we found in there.  I emailed Shadhi about this and she was very warm, supportive and understanding in her response.  The only minor problem that we encountered was that the TV and the internet weren't working.  I emailed Shadi about the issue and I got a prompt email back and followup call from her husband, Matt.  I ended up being able to figure out that a breaker had been tripped that had shut off all the wall outlets in the basement and hence knocked out both the internet and the tv.  Overall we had a nice experience at the house.  We were gone a lot of the time so we really only got to enjoy it in the evenings right before bed time.  But I would recommend it to anyone looking for a great rental."

The location of the houseboat was perfect for my needs, and you can't beat the price."

Kevin greeted us on our first day in Seattle with maps in hand and took the time to sit down with us to make sure we had a good feel for the city. Given Kevin and Louis' extensive time in the area, they were able to recommend a number of activities for us to do based upon our interests. Whether it was a new restaurant in town, a bookstore, or a museum, Kevin and Louis were able to point us in the right direction. They were fantastic hosts and always made themselves available, even for small talk as we would usually recount our day exploring the city. \n\nIn addition, the room was more than accommodating. To begin, just a few steps outside of our room, Kevin and Louis provided filtered water and a Keurig for hot coffee and tea. They also included candies to nibble on which was a nice little touch. The bedroom and bathroom were very clean, and the flannel sheets were a great addition to an extremely comfy bed. The room also hosted a large closet with extra heavy blankets for chilly nights.   \n\nThis was a five star stay. I highly recommend Kevin and Louis as hosts for your next stay in Seattle. "

The light link rail stop is a short walk, albeit with a bit of a hill and an overpass that you will not enjoy lugging your luggage over, which made it convenient.  The bathroom does not lock, but we did not have any issue in that area (not sure if any other guests were there though).  The breakfast was very tasty and Barbara was very helpful with spots to check out in town and informative about Seattle and the neighborhood.  If you don't mind a quirky house with a little character, this space is a good spot just outside the city proper."

Especially the hospitality Roda & Marvin give.  The little touches in this home make it a very inviting place to stay.  Cleanliness is above & beyond along with an ample supply of consumables to make the stay easy.  If there is another trip to Seattle I will check Roda's availability before checking for a flight."

He was not able to meet us in person but he had a designated person who opened the door for us right we we arrived.  When we arrived at the apartment, we found  a welcome letter, instructions and recommended places to eat and check out, that provided a very nice touch and were very helpful. The apartment itself was absolutely beautiful, I loved the decor and we found it extremely clean and welcoming. It was very comfortable and the bed was fantastic. We really appreciated having that air conditioning during that heat wave. The neighbourhood is very charming and conveniently located by an Interstate that would take you to downtown in about 10 minutes. Also, within walking distance to Freemont, which has lots of restaurants, shops and the Freemont Troll.  During our stay Cody continued to communicate with us and asked how things were going, we really had the most wonderful time and are truly grateful for the opportunity of staying in such a sweet home.

The house has a classic/vintage feel to it but, everything works like new (shower, WiFi, etc.). There is a lot of stuff (food, drinks, pot shops) within walking distance of the house. This was my first time at a bed and breakfast and it was a positive experience. I would stay here again and recommend it to my friends. Thanks Melissa and Abil.   "

The room was very clean, sheets were freshly washed, and the closet was stocked with anything I could think to need, from extra blankets to a fan in case it got too hot. While I was sharing a bathroom with the other roommate, fighting for bathroom time was never an issue. The bathroom itself was very impressive, it reminded me of a nice hotel, except I have never seen a hotel with a shower that had 2 shower heads, very impressive. The other roommate Jay was very friendly accommodating, always helpful and would even offer me some of the food that he would cook nightly. The owner Augustin was also extremely friendly and accommodating. He would make sure I had everything I needed, and even went so far as to invite me to one of his jiu jitsu classes (I was terrible). Overall I would highly recommend this listing, having not had any experience with Airbnb I'm not sure if this is normal, however I couldn't have asked for a better time "

The breakfast was very good too with fresh fruits, cereals, toast, milk etc.\nThe neighborhood is a very calm one, with the sea near by, nice little shops and also a very good organic supermarket (Sunsethill Green market).\nI can definitely recommend this place!

They are more laid back and less urban neighborhoods than closer to downtown but still vibrant and you will find plenty of options of food and live music and more."

It features security guards, secured entry, a beautiful and expansive rooftop deck, multiple common rooms with large sofas, full kitchens and tvs (one even had a fireplace!). Great location, can walk to the excellent Vivace for your morning coffee and Einstein Bagel is right around the corner for a quick breakfast. There's also a grocery store nearby and everything else is a quick uber/lyft ride away. "

The quietness of the neighborhood made us feel like we were in the countryside, while access to buses and the train station are all within walking distance. We visited Pritchard Beach several times, about a 5 minute walk from the house, and enjoyed skipping rocks in Lake Washington while taking in the beautiful scenery.\n\nWe had a memorable Christmas in Madeleine's home.

Perfect for 1 person (it's a twin bed), and the sliding doors provided me with the privacy I needed. This listing is absolutely accurate. Everything you need (restaurants, cafes, etc.) are within walking distance, and very convenient. Showa took the time to orient me as to where things were, and tell me all about Seattle. We had great discussions about everything, and I couldn't ask for a better introduction to this city. I'd definitely recommend this listing for anyone who needs a place to stay. "

We were in town for the Thanksgiving weekend and while dinner was at another house we were able to host a post Thanksgiving movie thanks to the generous seating in the downstairs family area.  Additional perks include walking distance to Metropolitan Market and close proximity to parks for the little ones.  Really great stay."

The house is located conveniently near bus lines, I-5, the University District and the University of Washington campus.  Scott and Delmis  also provided very useful information about recommended local restaurants and events.  We thoroughly enjoyed our conversations with our hosts and with the other guests.

The bathroom was a convenient to the bedroom.  The finished basement through which one walks to get to the bedroom is beautiful. We were pleased to have a strong cell signal in the room.  And, her garden tomatoes were a delicious taste of summer.\nOur only regret is that Reena was feeling less than well during our stay.  Would like to visit again under better circumstances.  "

They were so thoughtful over the holidays and went so far as sharing a bottle of their favorite IPA with us. They even left us a chocolate bar as a snack, and had a carton of egg nog in the fridge (which we did not get around to enjoying). We enjoyed our time here in Seattle and loved how quiet and easily accessible the neighborhood was. Parking was never an issue, and were very comfortable in our little cottage thanks to the 2 heaters! Laila & Luke were diligent in providing all necessary toiletries, should you forget them at home. The kitchen was stocked, and the bathroom was filled with everything you may need. "

The neighborhood is quiet and public transportation is easily accessible. Most importantly, Kristin has been extremely helpful. She promptly gave us detailed guidance on our itineries, and prepared delicious snacks and drinks for us. She even gave us a ride to downtown when we left. So we would definitely recommend Kristin, and would stay with her again if we come back to Seattle. "

One block to at least four bus routes direct to downtown and all the attractions; also, multiple, superb restaurants within walking distance. Parking space was a plus, but we would probably not take a car next time -- public transportation options, including Uber, were excellent.\n\nDavid was very helpful and responsive to our questions and needs. He gave us some suggestions for restaurants and city walks that only a local would know. And he always returned our texts promptly.  Our five day stay was terrific."

The location is a bit far from downtown Seattle (about 20-30 minutes via taxi) but there is public transportation available. There are guests in other rooms but they were quiet and kept to themselves. Overall very much of a hostel feel and very comfortable."

The staff was super helpful when it came to changing our dates due to an emergency and they always responded to my emails right away. The location was perfect because it is right in between he market and all the attractions like the space needle and museums. We were able to walk to every attraction we wanted to do, the farthest about a 20 min walk. Definitely recommend take the light rail from the airport to downtown Seattle. The tickets are only $3 dollars a person compared to a super expensive taxi or uber ride. Overall we loved the room and its location. We would definitely recommend this place to a friend or someone looking to stay in Seattle."

Very clean and comfortable. Bob was kind to check in about our needs for our new baby and offered a pack n play and crib in advance of our stay. The location was perfect for us and allowed for a walkable experience with our kids (coffee shop 2 blocks away, restaurants close by). Found street parking within a 1/2 block easily each day. The only thing that was a little tricky for our family was the number of stairs for lugging all of our suitcases and gear for the kids, and our big BOB stroller- stairs to the front door followed by a steep set of stairs to access the house, and another set of stairs to get to the bedrooms. We arrived later than we wanted to due to a less than happy baby, and hoped that we didn't wake our hosts with our many trips up and down the stairs to get everything in. That said, we would LOVE to stay here whenever we visit Seattle and would happily negotiate those stairs for such a sweet spot. The elevation is what provides the view and the sunny perch with peak a boo views of the space needle and surrounding areas. Gorgeous. If I could give more than 5 stars, I would! Fantastic spot. "

And we had access to everything in the kitchen. \nParking in the Seattle downtown is a nightmare. They have a parking pass to park in the street which still does not guarantee a spot. They kindly gave us the pass and in top of that saved us a space.\nWe had a great time at their room and I'd recommend it.  "

We checked in rather late (around 10pm) and Mike was emailing us to make sure we had no problem getting into the condo.  He is helpful and available when we had questions.\n\nWhen we were there, one of the elevators in the building complex trapped a resident for a few hours (from 11pm - 3am in the morning).   We did not know about it until some neighbors gathered around the building courtyard and when the police/fire department showed up around 2:30am.   From what we were told the poor guy had been kicking & shouting for help since he was trapped.   We used the stairs after this incident.    "

It was a fantastic experience from start to finish. \nThe house is as described, though it's hard to give a sense of how adorable it is in words alone. The kitchen is spacious with great appliances, the lounge is cozy and relaxing, the bedrooms are soothing sleep caves, and throughout the house there are delightful artistic decorations. \nFrom the first contact, Libby was wonderful hostess. She made the effort to find out what I needed and would like to know about as a newcomer to Seattle, and provided very useful and extensive tips and advice. She was very responsive and helpful whenever I had a question throughout my stay.\nThe area shows the best of Seattle. Greenwood is very artsy, fun,  and varied. Within a few blocks lie a 'Space Exploration' store, a theatre, a creative reuse for artists, coffee shops and a second-hand bookstore. The area is close enough to downtown via bus or excellent cycle routes for easy commuting in around 30-45 minutes.  \nLibby's house lies on a charming street away from the area's main avenue, and is blissfully quiet. I was studying intensively during my stay and being able to retreat to the house for quality rest and sleep helped get me through the work. I can't recommend the place enough. \nI found Libby to be conscientious, helpful and incredibly amiable. She's a great hostess and her upbeat and good nature was evident in every communication. I thank her for a marvellous time in Seattle. "

The place itself is heaven - right on the puget sound (ocean with spectacular island views). The house is a bit old but very cozy and had everything we needed. Our family loved our 3 night stay here.

The entry to the house was seemless, parking was never an issue on the street. The house was warm, although would be chillier towards the back of the house, it's older but cozy and well taken care of. We couldn't figure out how to turn on the light in the kitchen and Ann helped us right away. Washing clothes, dishes, using the TV, all no problem. We were traveling with a 7 month old and a 21 month old and the house worked very well for us. Two minor issues- there wasn't a flat sheet on our bed and the pans in the kitchen were all Teflon and older, no alternatives so we didn't cook much. \nLocation: we loved the location in Madrona, great neighborhood, nice park down the street and great restaurants and coffee shops a couple blocks away. Also an amazing view of Seattle!! I loved sitting on the couch, reading and looking out the big picture windows at downtown Seattle while my kiddos were napping. Nice, quiet neighborhood. \nI would definitely recommend this house for a family. Ann was wonderful to work with. My brother-in-law, who lives in Seattle, even walked into the house and said, \"I would buy this house!\""

We live in Seattle and wanted to have a \"staycation\" in W.Seattle, as we rarely make it over to that neighborhood. The Sweet Orange was absolutely perfect in every way. It was BEAUTIFULLY restored/decorated (Cassie has an amazing eye for color and design!), absolutely spotless and extremely comfortable. The house has a lot of charm, a view of the water (we were pleasantly surprised to find out!) and is in a great location. We walked a couple blocks to The Junction and ate/drank/shopped our way through the fun selection of shops/restaurants located there. \n\nCassie was an incredible host and fantastic communicator - someone needs to pin one of those \"super host\" medals on her! She responded to every question and request we had immediately (even while she was traveling to the East Coast on business), was super accommodating and provided us with detailed information that was much appreciated, as we were planning our weekend.\n\nI can't recommend this house highly enough - we had so much fun staying in it, and Cassie provided us with a wonderful experience!! There is so much to do in W.Seattle - no matter the season. Huge parks, great restaurants, Alki Beach - a weekend was not enough time to even scratch the surface, and we have promised ourselves we need to make an effort to visit more often!\n\nThank you, again, Cassie - for playing a part in such a fun weekend!"

He also left great instructions in the home. \n\nThe house itself is very comfortable and charming--we particularly enjoyed the common areas. \n\nThe kitchen in the house is also excellent. Alex has it stocked with great kitchen equipment and wonderful coffee making supplies as well. \n\nOne of the best things about the rental is the neighborhood. There is a nice zoo just a block up the street with a playground right across the street, coffee shops within walking distance, and great views all around. The neighborhood is also very quiet. \n\nThe only reason I am not giving 5 stars is that the stairs leading down to the second bedroom are very steep and might not be safe for all guests. For example, I did not feel safe carrying my baby up the stairs. \n\n"

There's a small supermarket 2 doors away in case of need, and the parking is super easy to access. The suite's kitchen has anything you need to make breakfast, and everything was perfectly clean and in place when we arrived. A thing that we appreciated was the wifi, which was reliable and strong. \nAlthough we didn't get to meet Sharayah, she left us clear instructions of how to access the suite, and her husband was available in case of need -- very nice people both. We'd stay here again and recommend it to everyone!"

Although they had made previous arrangements to be away for part of the Holidays, they left their numbers and the name and number of friends who would come if needed. Not needed.  They supplied generous goodies for our breakfasts They were also happy to allow us to have a small family party which was ideal because my grandson had room to play with his toys. There were some small difficulties, like dealing with the futon. Justin came and helped us.  The location is excellent, not far from Columbia City (yummy eats) and very convenient to the light rail. All in all an excellent value."

Let's break it down:\n\n1/ Cozy, comfortable space: there's warm lighting, comfy furniture, a soothing record player, and a homey feel.\n2/ Unique, artsy vibe: art and photography covers the place. I loved the decor. Not a single corner left me bored, there were so many charming details all over their place. You could really feel the personality of the hosts come out through their stuff.\n3/ A personalized experience: Angela left adorable little notes all over her house (e.g., explaining how her faucet worked or welcoming us). Really felt welcome.\n4/ The nicest hosts: finally, Zachary and Angela were so understanding and flexible. My friends and I were touched by how accommodating they were to our needs. These are two awesome hosts. I wasn't sure if I was more sad about saying goodbye to their space or if I was more sad that I couldn't grab a beer with them.\n\nLiterally, this place rules. But, in the interest of providing as accurate of a review as possible, here are the drawbacks:\n1/ Parking around here is pretty impossible. Honestly, that's expected in an area as hopping as Capitol Hill, but just throwing it out there.\n2/ There aren't curtains in some of the windows, so bring a sleep mask if you're sensitive to light! This didn't bother me, but my friends noticed it.\n\nAgain, these are nitpicks. Look at the space. There are plants! There are mannequins! There are dope photographs! Stay here!"

It's literally right across street from the Pike Market and is surrounded by all the cool places to eat, drink and shop. The owner Rex was very responsive to my questions before the trip which helped with my trip planning. Staffs working at the hostel are always willing to help and shared with me a lot of tips for where to go and what to see. The hostel was pretty clean and well organized. They do room cleaning every day to take out the trash and vacuum the carpet in each room. They also change the beddings as soon as people check out. There are plenty of private bathrooms for people to use and they are all pretty well maintained (no sharing). Overall, this place really is a good deal for people who are traveling on a budget and willing to make new friends."

She was very easy going, and very prompt with all our communication -- she even offered an early checkin to help my visitors settle in.\n\nThe place itself was spacious, clean, and very cozy. There were yummy cookies for us, as well as coffee, a ping pong table, a fold out bed, and plenty of room to lay back. \n\nThe location is great for those visiting Seattle and wanting a quiet retreat, access to Children's Hospital, the University, all while being within 5 miles of downtown. I will definitely reach out to Kendall again when we have the need for extra room!"

It was decorated per the description and was very nice from start to finish. \n\nI think my only concern with this property is the parking situation. It is at the end of a very small cul-de-sac and does not have much room to even drop off luggage.\n\nOther than that, the place is great. My mom loved it so much that she liked to just stay in and enjoy the comforts of the home. The location is great, very close to Seattle Center and awesome views of the Space Needle and the Bay just around the corner. The area is very high end with million dollar homes all around. Very posh in my mind. Great value compared to getting two bedrooms at a hotel.\n\nWe really enjoyed the home. One night we bought fresh fish, steak, veggies from Pike Place Market, brought it \"home\" and made a wonderful meal. I say \"home\" because we considered it home. I think we were all a little sad to leave it behind."

There were a total of five of us who stayed here (the property can sleep six), and there was plenty of room - bathrooms, kitchen and cooking space, laundry, even a fireplace for maximum coziness! The property was within walking distance of Ballard and having a garage was handy, too. Bus lines into downtown Seattle are easy and within walking distance as well, so you can avoid traffic and parking hassles at many of the most popular tourist attractions. We've stayed at other Airbnb properties and hotels in Ballard and this was by far the best.\n\nBut perhaps most importantly was our hostess! We had an issue upon walking in where the heat didn't work in a couple of the rooms, and the hostess was incredibly communicative throughout the entire process. Even though she was out of town she was in constant contact and also sent maintenance to correct the problem immediately, and this over the Christmas holiday! Our holiday vacation went uninterrupted and all was well. I don't have a bad word to say about our experience."

The living room is as open and inviting as it looks, and boasts an excellent, large flat-screen TV.  The little dining nook made a great work area, and plenty of floor space made it possible to exercise comfortably.   It's just bit over a mile walk into the heart of the city (downhill, so plan on the uphill walk back) with all that it offers.  I felt secure in the building and walking in the neighborhood."

He was quick to respond to questions and very accommodative regarding check-in and checkout times. Upon our arrival he went the extra mile to assist with our luggage, I really appreciated that! \n\nThe house itself is as described: modern, clean, spacious and very well equipped.\nOur room had one of the most comfortable beds. I loved the layout of the bathroom (Master bedroom).\n\nTed\u2019s house is centrally located, a 10-15 minute drive to and from major attractions. \nWe decided to not rent a car and to see more of Seattle by making use of public transportation (bus and UBER)-found it to be more cost effective plus it saves you from the hassle of having to pick and drop off a rental \u263a. The bus stop is right outside the house \u2013 we used it to go downtown as well as to the light rail station, which took us to the airport.\n\nGiven Ted's hospitality and our comfortable stay, we highly recommend his place.

The location was perfect for us as it was very close to where my daughter just moved to.  The house was smaller than I thought it would be given the pictures and the aerial view of the house but you can't beat the price and the location.  The bedrooms could use some dressers or luggage holders especially for stays beyond a couple of days.   A DVD player would have been nice to have especially since it was raining the entire time and we were not able to take advantage of the backyard or outdoors as expected.  Again - the location was perfect and the price was definitely reasonable.  "

We used the space while my husband had major surgery at UWMC and for his first week of recovery and it was perfect. It is a 2 mile, 10 min trip by car to the medical center. Jim provided plenty of linens and pillows and the access to a washer and dryer were perfect. The ability to access the apartment off of the alley without steps made getting around much easier than many Seattle properties. Jim is a low-touch host and we communicated through text messaging which worked well."

Me and my boyfriend were warmly greeted by them and the house was very clean and beautiful. What was great about this Airbnb was that we got not only 1 room to ourselves, but an entire floor. We had our own downstairs bedroom, bathroom, and living space complete with a TV, lifting weights, and a workout bike. Having that extra living room area was a great way to unwind at the end of the night and just relax like we were at a friend's home. The house was located very close to central Seattle, about a 10 minute drive away from everything you want to experience in the city. There was breakfast prepared for us every morning and they were super attentive to any needs we had. Overall I had a great experience, thank you Esparanza & Leo for giving me a great impression of Airbnb and Seattle!"

The house was delightful with a well-stocked kitchen (with tools one does not normally find in a rental).  The walls featured many works of original art which make the decor unique.    The house was also replete with interesting books.  The beds were very comfortable.  The shower was a bit quirky, and the water pressure was a bit low but adequate.  We admired the backyard but, due to Seattle's legendary rain, we were unable to enjoy it to its fullest.  Overall, it was a cozy locale for spending time with our adult children."

Forever??\" There were 6 of us ladies, and honestly never felt like I was too crowded. Each bedroom easily fits 2 people as does the living room. The sofa bed was actually comfy with no pokey springs of death! Bathrooms were so clean and cute. Oh and the kitchen was just great! I truly have no complaints and would love to stay here anytime I come back to visit this amazing city. Thank you for everything Christine!!"

We arrived by train from Seattle, and it's about a mile from King Street Station and a few blocks from the nearest LINK station if you're arriving from the airport. It was a very positive experience and check in and out was the easiest I've experienced. There is a concierge on duty what felt like around the clock, and happily let us in and provided us the keys. She helped us find groceries and gave us recommendations about the area. The home itself is gorgeous and the photos do a great job of showing how nice it is. We cooked several meals here and the kitchen was well stocked and the appliances were top of the line. Well worth it compared to the prices of nearby hotels."

He was always able to suggest things to do and see. You couldn't ask for a better host. Cam was kind enough to introduce me to 'American' football, just in time for the Superbowl final - what a time to be in Seattle!\n\nCam's house is fantastic. Honestly, I could not have been happier with my choice to stay here. I knew I was going to enjoy my stay as soon as I stepped out of the taxi! Comfortable, stylish (the pictures really can't hope to do it justice!), spotlessly clean, well-equipped (I wish I had Cam's kitchen back in the UK), and overall a great place to relax and make your Seattle 'home'. \n\nI was working at the University of Washington, and the location couldn't have been better - just a short walk along the waterfront, with views of downtown Seattle. There's plenty to see in Wallingford, but it's quiet and safe. It also has a 24hr supermarket. Fremont is also just a short walk away, with great coffee (of course). Plus, good bus services to downtown make this the ideal location.\n\nI'd definitely stay again, to hang out with Stella (Cam's ace dog) if nothing else! Highly, highly, highly recommended.\n\nThanks again, Cam."

Nina also provided some extra chargers and pamphlets of Seattle attractions, a very nice touch. \n\nShe also gave me the heads up her neighbor (I can't remember if they were up or downstairs) tends to play music on the weekend. It only lasted about a half hour-ish on Friday night around 9 PM, nothing I couldn't handle. Nina also provided ear plugs in case it bothered me. \n\nThe location of the building is ideal too, very close to the bus stops, a HUGE Starbucks, and other Capitol Hill attractions/night life/restaurants. Would definitely recommend this Air BNB to anyone traveling solo. "

Amenities were great and there were clear instructions on how to work the TV, stereo and the sound system. Even thou Molly and Rob weren't on hand they answered my inquiries right away. It was just what I needed for a little R&R."

The #7 bus stop is also only a two minute walk and will bring you to Pike Street downtown in 20 minutes.  The room is comfortable and well supplied with extra blankets, plushy towels, and clean everything!  Coffee is made every morning and a big bowl of fruit is ever present.  The kitchen has everything you may need and Beth readily shares the common areas for cooking, dining, or just to watch TV.  Safe, privacy, and the warmth of people await you at the Ethiopian Cottage.\n "

As others mentioned, the bed is very comfortable as is the large sectional sofa.  The unit was very clean and well equipped, but we were disappointed there was no cork screw. Luckily, the Safeway is not too far. \n\nDon't miss Bakery Nouveau on 15th...a short walk with exceptional bread, pastries and more.\n\nWe slept well in the quiet bedroom and loved the Apple TV as well.  We will definitely book again next time we are in town."

The decor in the apartment is, as the pictures show, unique and fun. We found everything to be clean and in good working order; the shower had good water pressure and temperature control. The bed was extremely firm, but not uncomfortable. Meredith was a great communicator and very friendly, both over email and in person. She shared a great list of places to eat, drink, play, etc. in Seattle, and we had an amazing dinner at one of the places she recommended. One thing to mention: parking in the neighborhood is very challenging, so if you are driving, be prepared to hunt for a good spot. We parked and then got around as much as possible by foot, which worked out well. Thanks, Meredith, for sharing your lovely apartment with us!"

What else ?\nParking lot, washer and dryer and everything you need in the kitchen and bath.\nWe really recommend it ! \nJust 2 things to know : a bit noisy but you are in town, hot when the weather is sunny but you have fans and AC in the bedroom.\n"

We were in town for a wedding and the location is perfect for all the sights.  The home was very comfortable and lots of history!  There are 2 delicious restaurants 2 blocks away and a great coffee shop too!  We had a great time and would definitely stay again :)"

Especially enjoyed talking about tech stuff with people who have different background. The house weekly party is also very very fun! I also gave a talk during my stay, which is really interesting. It's really a nice experience and I actually invite one of my friends to stay at the same place. Finally, I want to thank the house manager, Paul, who is a great and smart guy! Really enjoyed talking with you and your insightful opinion really impressed me! See you later, Paul! I highly recommend this place, especially people who like technology and willing to share you mind with others! This is definitely the best choice! \n"

We were in town to see our Giants play the Mariners and Tony was very helpful letting us know how to get around.\n\nThe beds were very comfortable. The town home is in a fantastic location, close to downtown and very quiet.  We didn't get to meet Tony as he was out of town. \nNo complaints just a heads up this unit has a lot of stairs so older or folks that have difficulty with stairs may want to select a different unit. \nWe had no issues with them but thought it would be good to mention this.  Also it was obvious that there was a little dog that lived there. We and our friends have pets so was not a problem but again some folk may have allergies.  The home was clean and had a lived in feel.  We appreciate Tony opening his home to us and would recommend this unit to others.  Also parking was easy and close. We felt very safe in the neighborhood and again appreciated the close proximity to Downtown Seattle. A very good value."

The neighborhood is very young as can be expected in University District, with college students dominating the area. It is also very central to many of the Seattle hot spots. One quick tip--if you're using Google Maps to locate the apartment, note that the reserved parking is in the alley between 19th and 18th (Google Maps will take you to the front of the apartment on 19th)."

Perfect location for going around Seattle without a car--- Westlake Station is just a block away (Link to/from airport, Monorail for Seattle Center, as well as buses), and numerous bus stops and the streetcar to Lake Union are within a few minutes' walk. For food, Pikes Place Market and a Kress supermarket are just a couple of blocks down. The apartment is also within blocks of wonderful high end shopping, as well as a Target and a Walgreen's for more common needs.\nHaving a kitchen allowed our family of three to occasionally make meals when we decided not to eat out, and a full size washer and dryer in the apartment was a major plus. We comfortably slept in the queen-size bed, while our child used the sofa. The apartment was clean when we came in, and great communication with Jordan and his assistant Michelle throughout the whole process. This is the apartment to stay at, if one were to visit Seattle!"

It sits on a hill, so from the dining room you can see the top of Mt Rainier, and from the dining room and living room you can watch the ferry crossing from Fauntleroy to Vashion Island.  The neighborhood is very quiet, and there was parking for our 3 cars - one in the driveway and two on the street in front of the house.  The bed in the master bedroom was comfortable, the hosts made us feel very welcome, and we were happy with our stay.  I'd recommend this house, and would stay there again."

Their home was just as they had described it and they had created a folder with very helpful information about the home, transportation, and different things to do in Seattle. They had breakfast goodies for us on the counter and coffee was provided as well, which was great!! \n\nThe check in/ check out process was a breeze and we had an amazing stay in Seattle. I would definitely recommend staying at their place if you are coming to the area. It is a short drive (~15mins) to Downtown and there is even a bus stop super close to their home. This was the first time I had ever used Airbnb and it was an amazing first experience. Thank you Kristina and Colin!\n"

It had been a very long and hot day driving to Seattle from Eastern Washington and although the temperature was also unusually high in Seattle, the Green Suite was excellent - refreshing, cool, and very comfy. Piper and her charming and knowledgeable daughter met us at the apartment to help us with entry and keys and then they gave us a lovely tour of the digs to help us get settled in. They were very kind, welcoming, and hospitable. Love, love, love the space and all of Piper's attention to detail, style, and sustainability. Especially loved the kitchen and awesome spa bathroom, as well as the lovely neighborhood, views of Lake Washington, the close proximity to the Magnuson Park dog run, and the beautiful blue hydrangeas outside the apartment entryway."

He provided great information for what to do in the surrounding areas and let us check out late on our last day. Huge help with our two boys in tow. The views from this property are unparalleled. Nothing fancy about the front \"deck\" area but all the fixings for great fires and smores. I would be so content waking up to the big windows and sounds of the water every morning. Bedroom was beautiful and the living area was small but very well equipped. We would definitely chose this area to stay again and have wonderful memories after staying at this property! "

My girlfriend and I had a wonderful visit and only wished we could spend more time.  She has a very well outfitted kitchen and we slept very well in the comfy bed.  She also arranged parking for us which was a huge relief because parking can be a challenge in the city.  Definitely recommend and look forward to visiting again."

The studio was clean, bed comfortable and kitchen useable!  We were able to make it dark for sleeping and opening the windows during the day was bright!  It's a block away from the movies.  I saw Star Wars while I was there! My local friends were able to find me easily.  There are restaurants and bars within minutes walking!  Fantastic location!  You do not need a rental car when you are staying here and I turned in my car just down the street at Hertz. Thank you.  I will be back for sure!  I love Seattle! "

Both Lake Washington and the city center are within walking distance - if you don't like walking: the bus just takes a few minutes. Jana was very welcoming and helpful and gave us a lot of information on the area and helped us planning our travels in Washington state. We'd definitely recommend staying at Jana's!"

The description of the house is not misleading whatsoever, it was beautifully decorated and big and open and very clean. It had a lovely backyard that was well-maintained and the neighborhood was quiet and just a street away from a waterfront park. Our host left us her cell phone number and allowed us to contact her if we had any questions or concerns. All in all it was a great experience, and I would definitely recommend it to anybody looking to stay in the Seattle area. "

I primarily chose this site due to its location being in such close proximity to where I would be working (a little over a mile away).  Plus, there is great public transport with bus stops close.  Lynn and Randy were very welcoming, always in communication and made me feel right at home when I arrived.  This room specifically is it's own floor with a private deck that provides gorgeous views of the lake, pointing you directly at downtown Bellevue with the cascades in the background.  No private bathroom, but the common bathroom on the second floor is well kept and it was not a problem sharing with the 1 or 2 other occupants who were renting other rooms.  The neighborhood is quiet, there was always available street parking if you do have a car, and all necessities (groceries, drug store, restaurants, coffee shops, ect) were in close walking distance, no more than 10-15 minutes on foot.  And, if you are a runner, this house is just uphill from the Arboretum, which I made ample use of as a running route during my stay.  I would gladly stay with Lynn and Randy again if my travels do bring me back to Seattle.  Thank you both for the excellent lodging."

It was definitely as described; no basement odor or musty smell despite being on the ground level.   My favorite part was the nice big shower with funky iridescent tiles."

The house is well-maintained with everything you need to make yourself at home as well as storage space for whatever you bring with you.  The bed is particularly comfortable.\nThe neighborhood (Upper Queen Anne) is quiet with easy on-street parking and lots of shops and restaurants a short walk away.  We were always able to park on the street very close to the house without difficulty.  There are two grocery stores and probably a dozen restaurants within a five block walk along with a variety of other stores.  There are also spectacular vistas of Puget Sound and downtown Seattle within walking distance.  There was very little noise, astonishingly so for such an urban location.\nNadia responds quickly to questions and requests and was an excellent long-distance host.  We stayed in the house for over four months and everything ran very smoothly."

She's a very thoughtful host, paying attention to the small details, like a personalized welcome note, a satchel of lavender with our clean linens and delicious local coffee. Though small, the space is cozy and the three of us never felt cramped. Bathroom and kitchen were very clean. The bed and couch were both comfortable. The location was convenient for exploring the downtown area - an easy 20 minute walk - though the trek back home could be tiresome with a very steep hill. We weren't too bothered by that, though. We also enjoyed the proximity of the Capitol Hill area, which had lots of shops, restaurants and beautiful neighborhoods. We would definitely stay at Marianne's the next time our travels take us to Seattle."

I was a little disappointed to find that the bed sheets had hair within and also came across a white stain (size of 4 quarters) on the bedding. I contacted Apryl and she assured me that the bedding was cleaned, but it still felt weird to sleep in the bed after finding the stain. Also confusing was that the post listed that it came with essentials, but I had to go out to buy shampoo/conditioner/body soap. Maybe my standards have been skewed from other Seattle Airbnb experiences?"

This home is in a great location on Beacon Hill very central to getting around the area. The room was very clean, well decorated, and large.  I loved having the extra sitting room to relax in after work.  The bed was very comfortable and I slept well.  The best part was my usual 1.5-2 hr commute was only 20 min!  I'll be back!"

It was already late in the evening when we came and Celia and her husband warmly welcomed us, showed around the house and gave us some ideas about the area. The house is very clean & comfortable. The guest bedroom is specious with a nice oversize walk-in shower. We were able to use the kitchen and I must say that their coffee is the best! Thank you Celia and Steve for letting us stay in your beautiful house and for the opportunity to meet you. "

She has a great energy about her, and she bent over backwards to make sure I had an enjoyable stay in Seattle. Kelly told me about the area, provided me with directions and things to do, and she makes a darn good cup of coffee! The room is just lovely. Great artwork and the space is perfectly cozy. I honestly can say I have zero complaints about this stay. Kelly is easily the best Airbnb host I've ever had. "

We did have a concern arise during our stay, and Shannon responded quickly and the matter was resolved quite well."

Be warned, however, of the two watchful golden lab/retrievers who patrol the side-street where the entrance into 1715 exists.  Thank you, Saleem!"

The wifi didn't work. The location is solid though. Loved the area, great places for a drink or coffee. If you don't mind walking a little, you can get to downtown easily too."

Sheryl was welcoming upon my arrival but explained the window in my room was broken out (it was being repaired on the floor of a rather messy living room ) and I would be staying in another room and that room was rented out for my 2nd night so I would then move into the room with the window problem. The stairway was raw wood as were all the window casings. Clearly much was in repair and my feelings is this is not a place to invite guest to stay for money. The curtain in the room I spent the night in does not cover all the window so to feel comfortable to undress I needed to turn off the light. I bolted awake about 5 am to what sounded like a rat in my room.  I cancelled my 2nd night at my expense and had to find another place to stay. The experience left me feeling upset and very disappointed. So much for charming!"

From the inside of the room there is a flight of stairs leading to the rest of the house and even though it only has a curtain partition we felt we had a lot of privacy. We share our bathroom with the host but that is not a problem with us as they kept it very clean. \nThe weather was turning and as the bed was just next to the door it got pretty cold for me at night. The room does not come with a heater but we did not ask for it either as Cynthia prepared a lot of blankets for us. Also the door has glass panels so we get the occasional beam lights, though not directly, and noise from cars passing. For those who need complete darkness and silence to sleep may need to consider this. \nCynthia is a wonderful and considerate host. You can tell by the number of blankets she had prepared for us and the jug of filtered water and cups on the dressing table for us. She made arrangements for check in really easy and checked in on us when we reached Seattle.  Once, she got locked out of her own house and was sitting on the porch waiting. She did not know if we were home and did not want to disturb us so she rather wait in the cold for her other housemates to come back. We just came back in a taxi and was surprised to see her. When we enter the house she jokingly thank us for letting her in into her own house. We had a good laugh. \nOur stay in Seattle was made much more memorable and pleasant because of Cynthia and I would certainly recommend her to anyone who wants a good location, fuss free and clean room.

The location right on Puget Sound cannot be beat and you can easily walk right onto a huge and lovely park just by walking out of the driveway and turning right. There is no through traffic on the street, so it is very quiet.\n\nVery few windows open, so I imagine it might be steamy in hot weather, although there are many fans provided. The kitchen has any small appliances you might wish, new frig, etc., but not very many glasses. Buy yourself a bag of ice! There are hotel style amenity kits provided, which was a nice touch, fluffy towels and nice linens. There is a serviceable washer/dryer. We provided our own detergent.\n\nWe hated to leave and would stay there again in a heartbeat. West Seattle is a neat neighborhood with plenty of restaurants and a short distance from Seatac. If you are inclined, public transportation is excellent.\n\nThe photos don't lie--this is a peach!"

Zoals het huis er in het echt uitziet komt overeen met de foto's, we vonden het zelfs groter dan verwacht. En het zag er net zo mooi uit als je zou verwachten op basis van de foto's.\nBij binnenkomst lagen er een flesje wijn en reep chocola op ons te wachten, erg lekker!\n\nWe verbleven met ons 5en in het huis, samen met mijn ouders, mijn man en baby. Het was niet ruim, maar paste zeker wel. Pluspunten vonden wij de veranda en de achtertuin, waardoor je ook lekker buiten kunt zitten. Ook handig dat we gebruik mochten maken van de wasmachine en droger in de kelder - vooral met een baby heb je dit wel nodig.\n\nDe buurt is erg rustig, en kindvriendelijk. We konden eigenlijk altijd zonder problemen voor de deur parkeren (gratis). Vlakbij het huis zit een park waar je lekker kunt wandelen, maar het is ook erg leuk om door de woonwijk te lopen en alle huizen & tuinen te bekijken.\nIn de buurt zitten meerdere horeca gelegenheden waar je koffie kunt drinken, kunt eten of eten kunt ophalen. Erg handig.\n\nHet contact met Tobin verliep probleemloos. Ze respecteerde onze privacy, en onderhield via Airbnb contact met ons. Voor vragen was ze bereikbaar, en we hebben haar ook nog even ontmoet toen ze een pakketje in ontvangst moest nemen dat bij het huis afgeleverd werd.\n\nAl met al vonden wij het een erg fijn huis in een leuke wijk van Seattle. Zeker een aanrader."

You could hear the chats outside so I suggest a small fan or a space heater to block the noise and feel more privacy.  Matt supplied a space heater which was nice, he was more available and ready to help. \n\nSome parts of the house are still being renovated so they are oldish.\nI stayed over two weeks so I needed more privacy after that. I had access to the bathroom upstairs which was a better deal than the other reviews. There are two cats that come in and out. \n\nThe kitchen is shared, so there is limited accessibility to preparing meals. I felt like I was getting in the way sometimes. \nFor me, it\u2019s been a while since I shared a space, so it felt a bit awkward, and I am a New Yorker who\u2019s more open and inclusive than the average Seattle person. But all that said, the room and bathroom were equipped and served the purpose. \n\nFremont is very cutet, it feels like a suburb at first but you can walk a few blocks down into the town center, it's a very small quaint area with nice cafes and bars. When the sun is out, it feels great."

The host provided us with coffee, tea and there were dishes, bowls, wine glasses, pots and pans and everything necessary for cooking on a stove, oven, and microwave. There were extra boxes of tissue for our noses due to the cold and wet Seattle weather and paper towels for unexpected spills and even books and a puzzle to keep us occupied without the need of a television. The Bose system and wifi was excellent. During the holidays, we streamed Christmas songs and played old fashion guessing games using our iPhones! Thanks for providing a great family experience."

The bathroom is shared, but it was always free and the bed is comfortable."

We rented a car so it was nice to have the secure garage spot as well.  While we didn't get an opportunity to try all of the bars and restaurants that we wanted to in the area, there are many dining options within walking distance.  I found the bed very comfortable and the furnishings were very nice.  It was also relaxing to come back to a place that felt like home versus the hotel experience.  "

Not sure if that is because of me reading the description incorrectly or if all airbnb's are like this.

It is ideally located in the Wallingford area for walks by Lake Union, local coffee shops and eateries serving all possible cuisines, the University of Washington and a large shopping complex. \n\nBirgit is a wonderful host even from a long distance! Kristina who lives on the premises is one of the warmest people we had met. Thanks to her the check-in was very smooth and the stay enjoyable. She took care of everything my guests needed and ensured they had a memorable stay. We have promptly booked it again for other family coming to Seattle.\n\nThanks Birgit and Kristina.

The location is really great and there are a lot of great places to eat nearby.\n\nMake sure you realize that the building requires you to sign a separate agreement, which for us required agreeing to pay some rather crazy fees if you did things like mixed the recyclables with the garbage or moved any of the furniture.  Everything turned out fine for us, but it's a little scary to sign a 19 page contract for a few day rental and it made us super paranoid while we were there."

Todd has a beautiful small (although felt much bigger than it was due to the layout) house near a dead end street overlooking Lake Washington and Seward Park.  The windows from the dining room had a fantastic view!  Todd has 3 young kids (so do we), and there were lots of toys in the kid's room (3 small beds) along with a train table, which made my kids feel right at home.  Outside there is a wooden play house/fort on the side yard, chicken coop with swing attached, and vegetable planters.  The highlight for our kids was probably the ramp that rolled a ride on top car down the hill in the back yard.  They probably did that 100 times each.  :)  There is no TV, but none of us really realized it, we were too busy planning our next outing, and the kids were too busy playing.  We were there over SeaFair weekend, and the location couldn't have been much better.  We could see the airshow going on out the front window, and hear the hydroplanes.  We took a quick 5 minute walk down the stairs at the end of the street and ended up at the bike path along Lake Washington.  We didn't even get a chance to explore Seward Park, but it is right there.  All the amenities you would really need, in a nice, clean, comfortable house with great views and a safe, semi-ritzy neighborhood.  We thoroughly enjoyed our 2 nights!  Thank you Todd for letting us borrow your house! "

Charming, cozy, super clean, comfy and spacious.  Plus the location is terrific within a safe and quiet neighborhood that is close to great little shops and dining options.  \n\nI stayed for almost 3 weeks, at her place, while my husband was in Denver packing up things for his trek to Seattle to meet up with me.  It was hard being away from him however having such a nice place to come home to after work made it much better.  \n\nI would highly recommend this location to visitors or people looking to move to Seattle.  The location is also simple to find  and an easy drive to downtown and near other hot spots within the Emerald City.  \n\nMisty has wonderful taste in her d\u00e9cor and some nice amenities to her little getaway including: tranquil bedroom that is spacious, big closet, gorgeous bathroom with claw foot tub, warm and cheerful living/den area with Keurig, mini fridge, microwave and washer dryer.  \n\nHer place is awesome as is Misty.  A wonderful hostess.  \n\n"

Great location near supermarket, public transport, and restaurants. Also close to bike share station and shoreline which made it easy to get downtown.  Not fancy but very comfortable. "

The cozy loft was cozy, indeed, and I thoroughly enjoyed many fascinating conversations with my host and other guests. Wonderfully delicious and healthy breakfasts and within 3 blocks of my family's residence, while easy access to mass transit or healthy walks to interesting aspects of the neighborhood and beyond. I definitely hope to return. Most appreciated the care with which the hosts schedule bookings. Not interested in the biggest bucks but the best experience for their guests!"

We'd definitely stay here again, it was much more fun than a boring old hotel!  Thanks again Rose & Glen, hopefully we can make it down to one of your places in Costa Rica sometime...  "

It was our first experience using airbnb, so we were a little unsure of what to expect - though the bar is now set very high.  The home was quaint and comfortable.  Although we tried to limit our electronics during the Christmas season, the house was fully capable with high speed internet and television in case we wanted to use it - though the main area was where we lounged each evening playing cards around the table.  The host was equally great.  She was prompt with all our questions and made the experience great.  I would highly recommend this place."

My teenage son and his friend stay with us and they had plenty of room to make themselves at home and relax.  The neighborhood was very quiet and quaint.  Nearby restaurants and shopping, the heart of Seattle just a short drive away, and beautiful Lake Washington beaches just blocks away!  The king bed in the master room was very comfortable and everything was clean and well appointed.  Adrienne checked in with us every day to see if we needed anything.  We felt very cared for look forward to staying again on future trips!  "

That alone should give you an idea of how much we liked it. \n\nHost: Dick is a great host. Very nice person. Takes care of things immediately when there is an issue. Quick to respond to questions and booking requests. \n\nApartment: Very lovely 1-bedroom apartment. Apartment is beautifully decorated and well-equipped with all you might expect. It has a private balcony and an awesome view. \n\nLocation: In one of the nicest Seattle neighborhoods. Quiet street. Short walk from Broadway or 15th Ave on Capitol Hill with all the stores, coffee shops etc. Only a few blocks from Volunteer Park. Easy access to I5. \n\nExcellent place to stay. We plan to be back. \n\n\n\n"

The remainder of the basement was very well done. It had I nice, comfortable room with a little dining area and kitchenette. The bathroom was nice and especially the showet. They had nice clean towels as well as shampoo, conditioner, body wash, lotion and just about anything you could need. The kitchenette also had a little minifridge, toaster over, coffee maker and a sink. They also offered complimentary coffee, sugar, tea, coffee creamer, water, and glasses and mugs which also added to the experience. We never even met Kelly, which was nice since I've always found it a bit awkward to stay at a stranger's house. We had our own entrance and any time we had a question or request Kelly was available via text to answer our questions and concerns. Overall it was a great experience and we would stay here again. Thank you, Kelly for sharing your space."

The wifi was a bit spotty at times, but sometimes it worked just fine. \n\nMy only feedback was I wish there was a larger mirror other than the bathroom mirror to get ready with."

We found what we expected thanks to Jills well thought out description. I even found some bonus items such as  a movie collection and a large supply of wood that Jill allowed us to use graciously.  The neighborhood is adjacent to the freeway so there is some road noise but we quickly became accustomed to it; the house itself is located off a small alley which leads down to a upscale cafe and yoga studio. We had to walk a mile or so to find groceries mainly because we set out looking for it without mapping it out. That provided an opportunity for a good walk for our dog which Jill allowed despite the last minute request! We are very appreciative of their hospitality and would certainly stay again.  "

What is understood as it is in U-District. It's also not to far away from downtown. Max. 20 minutes by bus and also 20 minutes by (website hidden) is just 10 minutes away and you can rent a bike for a good price to explore seattle on pedals.\nThere is also a Trader Joe's and lot's of possibilities to grab a snack or some to drink around the unit.\nAt night it was not to quiet but if you're used to citylife, you'll easily deal with it."

The house was always quiet and Nilda was quite friendly without being intrusive.  My only complaint was that the bedroom is right on a street so I would recommend earplugs for sleeping. This air b&b gets 5 out of 5 stars from me.\" \n\nShe also enjoyed the neighborhood a lot and the proximity to shops and restaurants in Beacon Hill.\n\nWe really appreciated Nilda being flexible and easy to communicate with!

The location is close to University of Wash and Children's hospital.  We were able to drive to Bellevue in 15 minutes one morning for an appointment.  There are many different markets within a few miles.  Our favorite was Metropolitan Market.  It was nice to have the bike path to walk on right at Matthews Beach.  The kitchen has everything you will need we cooked most nights including Thanksgiving.  There is a great deck off the back of the house but we did not use it.  The nice thing about this house even though it is cozy there are two distinct areas if you need them.  My husband could watch television in one room and my daughter could do her homework and practice piano in the other room.  Since we were down in Seattle for appointment at Children's Hospital we ended up just enjoying the house and not visiting to many sites.  We did enjoy a few of the coffee shops in the nearby neighborhoods.  Erin was quick to respond to every email message and was the best host.  We will look to stay their again on our next visit.  "

The space looks very nice, although a lot of the furnishings are old (sink & bathtub particularly).\n\nOverall, a comfy place to stay in Seattle!"

The windows are a little drafty but the heaters work well. The self check-in process was a little awkward but once you get the keys, it's all gravy. The kitchen looked like it had all the utilities required to make a meal but there were so many great restaurants nearby that we never got the chance use it. Overall great place."

Great location - awesome coffee shop 1 block away, a walkable grocery and drug store, a park across the street, and walkable or easy bus ride to get to/from many major tourist destinations. Amazing kitchen for those who enjoy cooking - and delicious coffee beans to use for those who need their cuppa joe first thing. Terrific views of the city skyline and mountains from 2 balconies. Great for families with school-aged kids - lots of toys to keep the younger ones busy. And so many books to read!\n\nHouse manager was very kind and easy to contact. Hosts were very generous and checked in via email regularly to ensure that all was well. We appreciated their detailed instructions so that all expectations were clear. Plus, a housecleaner came every week, which was a major plus for us!! \n\nThe home has a unique layout that was excellent for 2 couples - plenty of open spaces for group hangouts, and each party could have their own floor/bedroom/bathroom. Good to be aware that there are 4 flights of stairs to climb from the front door to the master bedroom - my parents and their guests, who are all in good physical shape and aged 60s and 70s, did just fine. Master bathroom is very nice - good washer/dryer.\n\nWe would highly recommend this home and host for anyone visiting Seattle for a short- or long-term visit!"

The room is a little small (as the listing states), but Bob was more than gracious about allowing us to store things in the various closets and spaces of the house. We checked out early, because we found a place to move into, and Bob went the extra mile to invite us to game nights at his house, even after we had left. Bob is a fan of music and art, so talking to him is always fun. The house is in a really nice neighborhood, with plenty of parking. I recommend staying here!"

The restroom that comes with the room is located upstairs and was always clean and available for my use. \n\nThe room itself is small and the bed was more of a memory foam placed on top of frame/ flat surface. It actually flipped on me as I rolled over during my sleep however it was manageable. I will say the sheets and comforter were nice though.\n\nAll said, I would stay here again given the same needs for the space."

I rented a car and found that I was an easy 10-15 min away from everything I wanted to see.  I did a lot of yoga around Ballard, Fremont and Queen Anne.  All the studios were excellent.  Coffee shops in all those neighborhoods are cozy and tasty as well.  It was great having a comfortable place to come home to each night.  Not having to bother with a key was excellent!    "

The good things about it are its location, only 5 min from the the University of Washington for those visiting there, that it is quite spacious and with plenty of natural light, and that Melissa was very helpful when needed. However, there are many bad things that would make us choose a different place next time. Most importantly, the bedroom is very noisy during the night because it faces the laundry room of a hotel. Even with the windows (double glazing) closed, the only solution for me was to sleep with earplugs every night. The other problem is that it is under equipped, we had to buy many things for the kitchen to function properly. Another thing is that when we arrived the place was not really clean, Melissa had to take out many things from the fridge and bin when we told her about it. Also, remember to ask for proper bed sheets, as the default was to have only one bottom bed sheet between you and the mattress and an electric blanket to cover you (difficult to clean properly). Overall, the place was OK, but too noisy and with below average cleaning standards."

I left my car in the small parking lot the entire week and walked to campus each day. The immediate neighborhood is full of dining options and shopping distractions, and the QFC grocery across the street came in very handy. The apt. was very clean and tidy, but it took me awhile to sleep through the street noise and lights.  Communication from Megan was prompt and helpful. "

And liked having washer and dryer in the apartment. Thank you Thomas!"

Target and the Pike Place Market are easily accessible, as are lots of downtown tourist attractions. In booking the stay, you will have several points of contact (all through Seattle Oasis Vacation Rentals), but they are very prompt in responding to questions."

If you don't want to leave the neighborhood, there are scores of bars, restaurants and coffee shops within a few blocks. We also made use of a small market a block and half away. We were able to get all of the essentials and they even had a decent selection of wine. The apartment itself was great! Very spacious and comfortable, with views of the Space Needle and Sound. Lisa Marie was very communicative and the most accommodating host we've ever stayed with. Would overwhelmingly recommend that, if you're ever in Seattle, you stay with Lisa Marie!"

Beds in both bedrooms were comfortable and the shower has excellent pressure and water coverage - a definite plus for me.  We stayed on a very hot weekend and the home is not air conditioned, so we toasted a bit, but Nikki has fans in every room and we were all so tired after all our activities every day, nobody seemed to have too much trouble sleeping. There is a very large park directly across the street, which we didn't explore much, but provides an absolutely sensational view at sunset. We also discovered Chinooks, a ridiculously good seafood restaurant on the water only a mile and a half away from the house.  Finally, Nikki was kind enough to let my son play one f her guitars when we were there, which we couldn't get at any hotel. We paid less than half what we would have staying downtown, got the space of a Presidential Suite, peaceful, quiet nights and easy access to everywhere.  Tip: we tried Uber for the first time. They pick you up in minutes, get you where you need to be and cost a third of the price of parking downtown for a couple hours."

It didn't take more than a few minutes to feel as though we were breaking and entering, that is, not welcome whatsoever. The kitchen was not particularly clean and the laundry room, where we were instructed to hang our clothes, was a complete wreck. In the master bathroom, only one piece of tiny, well-used soap was left for us, along with bleached-stained towels. The nightstands in the master bedroom had stacks of books on top of them. The master bed was very nice, and it was the only redeeming quality that we found here. Overall, we found the pictures posted on the Airbnb site to be very misleading. It astounds me that we paid well over $700 to stay here. Don't make the same mistake. \n\n"

The room was clean,comfortable and quiet. Close to some great local restaurants, the supermarket, pharmacy and really easy to get down town. Also really close to green lake, a beautiful place to go and exercise in the mornings or take a walk. Loved it and would recommend to anyone visiting the area."

Access from/to the airport is also very easy via the light rail system.\n\nIt is spacious and well equipped and right by all of the bars and restaurants in the Pike Place Market area. Downtown attractions are mostly walkable and the monorail to the Seattle Center / Space Needle is just a couple of block away.\n\nJeff is a fantastic host as well, he met me to give me the full tour of the apartment as well as the many facilities available in the building and throughout the process was a great communicator responding very promptly to any and all queries. He is also a fantastic source of local knowledge having lived in Seattle all of his life! \n"

Slightly expensive for what it was. The room is not attached to the bathroom, which was not a big deal, but with both doors being glass front, it feels a bit exposed. The house  is old so you are able to hear EVERYTHING. Just footsteps upstairs and the shower turning on was quite loud. Kim was welcoming and had lots of great insight on Seattle culture. "

Moves are stressful in the best of circumstances, but during the winter holiday season it's particularly hard not to be in the cozy familiarity of your own home. \n\nThe hospitality and generosity Eileen showed me during my stay remind me of the reason Airbnb exists: to make you feel at home, anywhere. \n\nDuring my time with Eileen (and Higgs, easily the coolest, sweetest dog I've ever met), she made me feel completely at home in her beautiful, spacious, overflowing with charm Craftsman. She really loves Seattle and all of her recommendations (where to eat, shop, find the best coffee, pastries, etc.) were spot on\u2014and I'm pretty selective. \n\nAlso, it can be tough to share a space with another human\u2014even if it's temporary (I usually rent entire apartments or homes). Eileen is both accessible and very respectful of privacy. I enjoyed many lovely conversations with her but also enjoyed having my own space. \n\nAll in all, Eileen made a stressful transition month so much easier and more enjoyable. If you want a beautiful, cozy home away from home, unbeatable city location, and sage local recommendations, you should definitely book a stay here. "

The apartment was just as described, and we found it very beautiful, homey, clean, and convenient, and the photos don't even do justice to the gorgeous view! The neighborhood was wonderful, too--quiet and pretty, and with a great little coffee shop a very short walk away. Elise left a detailed note with information about the apartment, and we found everything we needed. The cat was an added bonus! I would absolutely recommend this apartment to anyone looking for a place to stay in Seattle!"

Really, there was a sort of magic about looking upon the cityscape like I was a queen in a modern day castle. The hot tub wasn't available - but the lightning fast replies and kindness from Chris and Hailey more than made up for it. Thanks guys!"

Our airbnb place wound up being the gathering place for us all. We walked easily to coffee,  market, shopping center, and restaurants. Bonus was we opted not to rent a car, but our location was easy for uber and lyft drivers. Our host left some great basic food items, if needed (thank goodness) for the coffee left.I love to cook and hoped that I would've pulled off some great family meals here, but for us CA folk, not used to not being comfortable grilling (too wet). The only downside we could say is if noise (furnace) bothers you,  you either need to wear ear plugs or stay at your son/daughters place. My husband was annoyed with the furnace noise! Since the furnace was for the whole house and took up one of the walls in our place. I would not hesitate to rent this placed again, but with my husband would only rent during a no furnace season."

I have never stayed in a floating home before and I loved being right on the water. Literally. Watching the sunrise and sunset and the sailboats passing was beautiful. I slept so well with the peacefulness and gently movement from the water. It was truly the retreat of rest I was seeking. I went home completely refreshed. The home was very clean and just as described in the listing, I was very comfortable. I really enjoyed the neighborhoods and all they had to offer, so much was within walking distance or a quick Uberx ride. The hostess was delightful and respectful and I am so grateful for my time there. I am looking forward to visiting again!"

Her bike borrowing system was invaluable for commuting to town for yoga, food and parks. Pikes place was just a 40 minute pleasant bike ride away. Ballard is a nice, safe neighborhood. Loved it!"

Sleep kit just another of the many amenities KT provides in the place.  Back yard is a little funky, but all part of the charm.  Stay here if you are artsy and want a small, clean place in a great location."

It is tastefully remodeled yet keeps all the charm and character of its era. It is extremely clean, comfortable (perfect for our family of four), cozy, well updated and best of all in an AMAZING location, walking distance from many attractions, restaurants, supermarkets and shops."

The location is great with a view of Seattle right outside.  I got to meet Dan and his family and they are the sweetest people you could ever meet.  We were lucky to have found his home.  Highly recommended!"

I was contemplating about renting a car (because we all had different arrival and departure times and it's about $32-$40 one way with uber). She replied back quickly to confirm there was plenty of free residential parking. The place is cute, two of us slept on the bed and one on the couch. She was very accommodating, gave us lots of info, even gave us suggestions based on what we like to do. She provided extra sheets and a comforter for the couch sleeper, there's a full kitchen with enough things to cook with if you decided to stay in, she also provided towels for all of us. There's a nice large fridge, heating was great, everything ran so smoothly! Oh and she offered early check in. Loved it! Would completely stay here again! Thanks so much, Rebecca!"

There is a king size bed for 2 people and for a third person  a very small, tiny and narrow sofa, that is good enough to have a short nap!!!!  When I called to a property management and told that... The answer was : we can deliver a air bed for 50$ delivery fee ?!?!? Why ?!? We paid for a night 319$ US. \nThe second one, there is NO internet ! We again, called to the property managemnet and asked if there is a wireless or wired Internet ! The man on the phone said,he would call to the owner and asked for a WIFI password and log in. Never called  us back :( \nThe third, it was very cold in the appartment ! There is no an instruction or a guest info book or so... \nWe at our own risk, opened the hitter's vents and eventually it was little bit warmer! \nOne more thing... The building is very old so it is very smelly :( .. \nThe next one, we also paid a cleaning fee 84$. But all hitters are dusty.\nThe last,  but also very stressful... The address of the building  is 304 Bell street , and there should be a lock with an apartment's key, but the lock was attached to the 308 Bell street building's door :( who knew it ?!? :( \nto figure out all these issues I had to call to the property management several times by using my cell with roaming rate and now I can imagine my Fido bill !   stay away from this place ! I am  a Airbnb member since 2011, I am not picky at all,  but this time it was to much :( "

It was neat to eat breakfast and watch as some small sea planes take off and land in the water (you can't hear them at all). The bed was comfortable and I had my own bathroom.

Many tourist attractions walking distance, allowed us to skip on car rental as it was not necessary. The only improvement I would like to see in the future is for the apartment to have good wifi coverage through the rooms. Currently from my experience, the wifi signal was very weak into master bedroom. Furthermore, I did see some lag when multiple people were utilizing the wifi. Being a techy, that was important to me. For the most part this place was gorgeous and I would recommended future visitors to stay here. "

The bed was extremely comfy, and the internet speed was fast as well. Highly recommended and hope to stay again!"

The downstairs bedroom futon could use a little improvement for my taste as I tend to prefer a real mattress. \n\nOverall the house was comfortable and would recommend their place to anyone looking to visit the Seattle area."

Our friend slept very well in the Master bedroom. Bathroom was bright and clean with an incredible shower. There were random noises like the furnace going on and off so if you're a light sleeper like me bring ear plugs. Also, you're in a separate unit from the home owners but you can hear them walking and talking upstairs. Unfortunately the fridge wasn't working which was an inconvenience with the baby but we were given notice prior and brought an icebox. The location is superb - in quaint Queen Anne with walking distance to the main strip. Free parking right infront of the house was great. Overall we had an exceptional stay and would highly recommend the place. One our top airbnb stays. Thank you Kurt and Anna for being prompt and very accommodating! "

He even allowed us a late check out, which gave us a little more freedom to make the most of our last day in Seattle before our evening flights. The apartment was ideal in every way: location, size, amenities, dishes and silverware, heat, and even decor. Everything was in walking distance. My friends and I agree: we would happily stay here for our next visit to Seattle."

I think she is admittedly a bit of a pack rat and has lots of business \"stuff\" in her house but if one uses the lower sliding door from the garden they basically have any area with the bedroom, an open area, and a full bathroom to themselves and can have complete privacy and access to the garden. The neighborhood is nice and plenty of parking. It seems that a car is necessary to get to restaurants etc on Ranier Blvd or to public transit. The bed was a simple foam pad mattress on a slat frame but was surprisingly comfortable!"

There are a lot of grocery stores and bars/restaurants nearby so we could see someone with more time and money having a great time exploring the local culinary scene.\n\nThe apartment is very well decorated, and is in reasonable repair. The building itself seems old though, and there were some issues with the apartment like sticky doors and mould in the bathroom roof that come as par for the course for a building of it's age.\n\nAll in all a great location at a great price, it would serve well for anyone looking to go out and explore the sights of Seattle, and suited the two of us while we were attending a convention about half an hours walk away.

Bedroom and bathroom are in a large separate suite area that can be closed and locked from the rest of the house (since apparently sometimes the downstairs resident uses the kitchen) if that's a concern; we never saw him or anyone else in the house, and felt completely at home. Oh, nice bath products too! Walkable to everything on 15th/Capitol Hill, and Uncle Ike's if that's relevant to you."

Nathan's place was very spacious so it was perfect for us, our toddler and my sister. It comes with a one space garage so great for parking."

She has lots of tourist resources and brochures to help you decide how to spend your time in Seattle. She will gladly give you recommendations on restaurants, activities, etc, or let you be if you wish for peace and quiet. Her place is a convenient 10-15 min walk to pike's market. \n\nThe surrounding neighborhood is relatively safe. Just be aware and smart when walking home at night from the downtown area.\n\nThis was a wonderful place to begin using airbnb and I will certainly return the next time I visit Seattle. I highly recommend for anyone - whether you are a tourist seeing Seattle, on a business trip, or just need a relaxing staycation. "

Very sweet, genuine people!!! \n\nThe home is well-kept and clean.\nThe kitchen is communal and available to you.\nBedroom #2 shares a bathroom with only one other individual; no conflicts arose there.\n\nThe rooms are close together, so it is ideal to be mindful of noise.\n\nThe location is VERY close to a bus stop, which was super convenient to help me get downtown several times!\n\nLoved my first experience with Air BNB - thank you for motivating me to continue using this service and showing me what is possible!"

To get there from the airport we took the light rail all the war to the end then Ubered (only like $7-$8). Downtown is a very pleasant 30 minute or so walk from there and there are tons of great spots to eat/drink nearby which we discovered on our first night there thanks to Joe's recommendations. This place has everything you need to be comfortable. The bed was great (even though it did seem a little short, but I guess my sister and I are kind of tall!) Throughout our visit, Joe was always keeping in touch and making good recommendations, many of which we ended up doing. I like that there is a fridge for leftovers and a microwave. Capitol Hill is an awesome neighborhood and I would definitely stay here again. "

Definitely recommend their apartment. "

If all you need is a place to crash, it gets the job done.  The bed was very comfortable, but the apartment lacked some of the features that make it an easy place to stay - no end tables, no bedside light or floor lamp - just the big ceiling light. Small kitchen has a coffee maker, but bring your own coffee, cream and sugar, etc...  Like I said, decent for crash pad, if that's all you need. "

The house was only a 15 minute walk to the local organic grocery store, PCC. The light rail is very close to his house too and can easily be taken to SODO area for shopping and cannabis! Sebastian is a very interesting guy to talk to. I highly recommend aligning your trip with one of his cannabis events!! Too much fun. "

My wife commented that she didn't think anyone had ever stayed there.  It looked exactly like the pictures online.  It is located in an older neighborhood, but a clean one.  A little noisy due to traffic, but we live by a busy street so that didn't bother us at all.  Just a couple of suggestions:  A TV channel lineup would have been helpful.  Also an extra blanket in the colder months.  And a pen and some paper would have been nice.  We discovered a great shortcut to the downtown area avoiding the freeway, and we loved that.  It took us right by the two sports fields on the way.  All in all it was much more fun than a motel.  We love Seattle!"

The guest space - including private connected bathroom - is the entire bottom floor so it's very private. At the same time, they were very open to my using the shared kitchen or living room if I wanted. The location is very residential and quiet. Short walk to the heart of Columbia City, somewhat far from light rail, but still walking distance (maybe 15-20 mins)."

Skip met my parents the evening that they arrived when he popped by to day hi - they noted that he was super friendly. My folks will definitely consider staying at this location in the future. I think that the only downside for my parents was that they like a colorful place and - while well decorated - the tones of this airbnb are gray/modern. Personal preference, I suppose!"

The Ranier Valley neighborhood is a fascinating mix of cultures (Ethiopian restaurants and Buddhist monasteries, to name a few) and is easily accessible to downtown, and from there to anywhere. Plus, if you like fresh-baked cookies or breads, or homemade soups, you'd love Mary's house for that reason alone. \n\nThe house is high energy\u2014both Mary and her dog, Gracie :-) \u2014so come prepared for lots of coffee and friendly conversation. But if you're not into those things, you'd probably still enjoy a visit. "

It was my mom's first experience with Airbnb, and she was very impressed. "

The house is walking distance to downtown Ballard and the Locks and it only takes 15ish minutes to get into downtown Seattle by car. The location was nice for us in that it was a quiet, peaceful setting on the water in Ballard but still conveniently central in greater Seattle. The rooftop deck overlooking Salmon Bay was everyone's favorite feature for enjoying a morning coffee or meal with drinks. Great place!"

The location was great too, two minutes from an excellent coffee shop, and a 5-10 minute walk to many many, bars cafes etc. A bus that goes downtown was right on the corner. Definitely recommend."

We also thought the fitness center was above average. It even has a small rock climbing wall. So yeah, over a month spent there and it was great... Beyond expectations. "

We used the vintage 1935 gas stove to heat our pastries which was well explained and easier than we thought.  The beds were reasonably comfortable. We used all including the futon and the mattresses and slept well. We used the deck in both sunny and damp weather.  It really made tight quarters for 4 adults work well. The shower, which was in the cast iron bathtub was great pressure and temp. We had a little trouble getting in initially, but with a phone call to Shawn got that straightened out. A memorable visit to Fremont!"

She accommodated to my schedule regarding check in and check out and was very responsive when I had any question . \n\nThe apartment is beautifully decorated, very spacious and well equipped. I was cooking almost every evening and had everything that I needed. The bed was very comfortable and the bathroom is great, with a nice and large shower and heated floors.\n\nThe apartment is conveniently located. Buses downtown and to the university are close, the Burke Gilman bike trail is 5 min away. Furthermore, there are nice restaurants and coffee shops around. I also had a rental car and always found a parking spot closeby.\n\nAll in all, I had a great time and can very much recommend staying in Carrie's apartment."

Queen Anne itself is super cute and walkable with some great restaurant options.  The apartment was wonderful to come back to for a cozy wind down from a day of exploring Seattle.  The fully stocked kitchen allowed us to make a few meals in during our week-long stay.    \n\nNicole was a responsive host from the very beginning.  Replying to messages and questions in a timely manner.  While we didn't see her or her family during our stay, we did hear them every once in a while.  However, coming from a multi unit in Chicago, that didn't bother us.  \n\nWe would love to stay here again should we return to Seattle for a visit and Nicole would have us!  \n\n"

The flat is on a very quiet street, but is walkable to restaurants, bars, a drug store, and a market. Shan was accommodating and very communicative. Would definitely recommend this beautiful abode."

The bathroom and kitchen could really use a deep clean (tub and toilet were stained and the mirror and sink weren't super clean). I think the problem was that we booked last minute (the night before we checked in), so it may not have been enough time for Matt to really do a deep clean.  Besides the cleanliness it's an older building and there isn't much that Matt can do about it, but the carpet really needs to be replaced and the entire apartment could use a really good scrub, especially the bathroom.  Overall, I thought $199/nt + fees and taxes was too expensive for the apartment.   We had some problems with check-in, but Matt called an hour later to ensure we were able to check-in, which was really nice. "

Downtown is only a 5-10 drive away and there are many restaurants around the area.  \n\nThe host was very prompt in responding to our questions and Mary was extremely helpful with following up.   I don't have anything negative to say about the property.   We have extremely enjoyed our stay and would definitely come back. \n\nJust an FYI: The garage can only fit a compact car; however there are plenty of parking on the side of the streets.   Also there is no AC but for Seattle weather in October we didn't it.  There's a fan in every room if you need it.  "

The decor/feel of the apartment and building is so much better than some modern high-rise in my opinion (the Pioneer Square area is as a whole).  We arrived on the light rail, day-tripped on ferry, departed by Amtrak... all within easy walking distance.  Though we arrived before check-in, we were able to store our luggage... couldn't have been an easier process.  For us, a huge part of our stay, was the great input, warmth and humor of all three women working at the saloon/cafe.  We'll definitely stay again the next time we are in Seattle.  Thank you!"

We felt like family from the moment we met her and it was much easier to share the space with her than I would have guessed. Moreover, the apartment was very well located for our needs and though we had to use on/street parking,it was always available right across the street. The only problem, from my point of view, is the age/quality of the building. The building is relatively new, but not in my view, especially well kept up. There does not appear to have been any attempt to update or renovate any of the spaces, public or private, and the deterioration shows. Also, the room is smallish so that there is no space for an easy chair in it should a guest wish to relax in privacy. That having been said, the positives will far outweigh the negatives for many, if not most, people. FYI, my husband and I are 76 (almost 77) and 71 which may explain my issues. But one could not ask for a more lovely hostess."

The neighborhood is one of the nicest in the city and has two very convenient bus lines that are extreamly close by and take you everywhere downtown. My friends who lived there were very envious that I got to enjoy such a beautiful location every day. I would definitely stay there again."

It s 10 minutes from bus from city Downtown. \nthanks a lot Vaibhav for the Hosting ;)"

The rooftop deck was perfect for afternoon wine and cheese. Every place we visited was in close walking distance and there was just too much to see in the short five days we were there. We did not even need a rental car. The bus and light-rail was easy to navigate.\n\nIt was nice to sleep with the sliding door open but we are in the city so there is a little noise to get use to. Otherwise, it was all perfect and we will definitely come back another time.\n\nThanks Trace. Go Seahawks!"

I was told to tell them that I was a friend of Michael's, yet another manager came up, insisting that I give my name and phone number because they had caught Michael renting to people on AirBnB before, which was apparently a violation of his lease. \nIt was an incredibly unpleasant experience that I informed Miranda of (the third official host I had dealt with for a three week stay), who simply told me she would inform Michael, neither of which contacted me.\nI recommend avoiding this conglomerate of unofficial corporate apartment renters who claim to own over sixty places in the Seattle area. Sure, the apartments were clean, tastefully furnished, and had the listed amenities, but they are cleaned by a professional cleaning crew after each stay and do not seem to be frequently checked on by the hosts, judging by the amount of cardboard boxes, random items, and various other belongings left behind in the closets and drawers."

This is most likely due to the heavily (can't emphasize enough) stained carpet in all of the hallways and stairwells. It hit me like a ton of bricks when I walked in. I gave it the benefit of the doubt and went up to the apartment but the smell was still too strong. I am allergic to mold/mildew and it was making very difficult to breathe. I understand that this is not the host's fault, necessarily, but it would have been nice to know ahead of time that the building was pretty dank (not just \"old\"). However, even if I had stayed and not had to pay $250 /night to stay in a hotel instead, I still would not have been very comfortable staying here. While it was tidy, it was not very clean. The bathtub had smudges that I was not prepared to risk bathing in and there was a noticeable amount of hair on the bathroom sink. I didn't spend more than five minutes in the home so I can't give more details than that. I have not been offered a refund either. "

If you aren't planning on travelling too far, I'd recommend not having a car as parking was extremely difficult since it is a very popular area. It's only 2 blocks from the light rail that comes directly from the airport and lots of bus routes."

The closet and bureau drawers had ample room to stow my belongings during my stay. The two guest rooms share a wall, and, because noises travels, I was appreciative that the other guest didn\u2019t snore. The shared modern bathroom is convenient to the bedrooms. It is spacious, features thoughtful details, and as immaculate as the rest of the house. Ourania helps guests set designated shower time to get everyone in the household gracefully through morning preparations.\n\nOurania\u2019s older cat Diva learned that I had a welcoming lap and adopted me quickly, following me upstairs to my bedroom. One has to be quick to shut the bedroom door, as the house rule is \u201cno cats in the bedrooms\u201d. Good rule. \n\n Ourania is not only kind, but she is also generous. She clearly wants to make her guests comfortable. She installed a night light in the bathroom for guests that have need of the bathroom at night. She loaned me an umbrella and procured a lightweight blanket for my comfort because the weather was unpredictable. \n\nI wish I had had more time to visit with Ourania. Next time!\n"

Communication with Kelly was easy and very fast. The room is small, but very functional. She has laid out some maps and restaurant menus from near by attractions. Her cat was very peaceful and quiet."

We very much enjoyed walking the waterfront both in the day and night hours and felt very safe.  We would not hesitate to stay there in the future!  "

Only a $5 uber from downtown. I especially loved how close the Starbucks Reserve was and went there more than once to get their shakerato! The living room is a bit more cramped than the pictures show as there are desks and chairs to one side, but they were not an inconvenience. Perfect place for one person or a couple, but I wouldn't recommend trying to spend too many nights on that futon. The check in and check out process was simple and flexible which we appreciated. It is an old building with an old elevator but we found the place clean, organized, and perfectly situated. Thanks for having us Mark!"

After checking in, we were headed out to see the Sand Point Tennis Club and Stacey had caught us as we were leaving.

The apartment is quiet and the gated parking area is a huge plus.  \n\nThere were just a few minor issues that needed some attention (internet access problems_ but the organization (Pillow) that Rob and Ann use to help with these things has a 24-hour phone line and could solve them quickly and easily.   \n\nAll told, I would highly recommend this location to anyone visiting Seattle who wants to get away from downtown but still wants access to everything Seattle has to offer."

Check in was easy, we picked up keys early but check in is 11am. The neighborhood is very nice, in south lake Union a half hour walk to Pike Place and all the action, and a quick car ride to other neighborhoods like Capitol Hill. The apartment building is secure and clean. The unit itself was also very clean and nicely decorated. It's a lived in apartment but still felt welcoming, comfy bed and clean bathroom. The rooftop view was gorgeous.\n\nAll in all a great private apartment and good neighborhood, just not super central. Would recommend it to folks looking for some luxury and privacy."

She helped welcome us and got us oriented to both home and neighborhood.\nThe 4-bedroom home is spacious, well lighted and featuring comfortable beds. It isn\u2019t a full-time rental. It\u2019s Ann\u2019s home, but she arranged things so that we could stay there very nicely for four nights. She even found a place for her two cats to stay since some in our party don\u2019t do particularly well with pets. That was much appreciated.\nThe established Madrona neighborhood is a great one to explore. We took sets of public stairs down past hillside homes and streets until we entered a short trail that led to the shores of expansive Lake Washington. We ate breakfast, along with many locals, at the yummy Hi Spot Caf\u00e9, an easy walk from the house. And we enjoyed being about 15 minutes away from Pike Place Market and Seattle Center.\nI highly recommend this home.\n"

Jerome is a very friendly and helpful host, and brewed up our hot coffee in the morning.\n\nA few items worth noting: 1) there are stairs from the street to the front porch, and also up to the second floor bedroom, and 2) the bed was firmer than what I am used to at home.  We appreciated having our own key to the house, and a key to our bedroom.  We will try to stay at Jerome's on a future visit to Seattle.\n"

The photos really don't do this place justice. It is tastefully decorated to a high standard and the view is just amazing. We watched the sun rise on the morning of check out and it was so impressive! Location is perfect if you want to be near downtown - you are within walking distance of the famous pike place market and even the space needle. Both bedrooms have ensuites and Windows from all angles to take in the view. Overall, a very pleasant experience and would stay here again! Thank you Maria."

During my time there, I didn't get to meet Michael or Leah but Leah had so many signs and notices of who they were, it seemed like they were there. The permanent residents were really cool people all of them who were all very friendly. The space itself was also just so great. The house was huge and very well organized (and ridiculously clean!). I spent so much time just relaxing in the office reading in my off time from being a tourist around the city. I'd recommend Crayola Home to anyone."

Dee is a perfect host...communication was easy, our flight was delayed several hours so we came in very late (early morning actually) and were able to make a plan.   Directions to the house were clear.  There was a welcoming note and fresh flowers. The apartment is spacious and comfortable...furnished in a very attractive simple style. A comfy bed,  down comforter and nice linens, lots of hot water, an outside Jacuzzi and a responsive thermostat in each room made our winter visit very cozy.  \nThe Columbia City/Seward Park neighborhood has great restaurants and access to all kinds of food shopping..and a light rail station within about a mile. There is easy access directly from the house to Lake Washington trails...really a nice base for a Seattle visit!"

We really felt like we were in our own home.    This is in no small part due to the fact that the owners actually live in the home; it is not used exclusively as a rental property.  The kitchen is fantastic.  Very well equipped.  We found everything we needed for our Thanksgiving feast and more (they actually left quite a number of treats for us in the refrigerator).  We wished we had more time to have fun in the kitchen!  The house is as you see in the photos.  Well maintained.\n\nThe neighborhood is really lovely.  Volunteer Park is very close.  Restaurants and shopping are convenient.  We had an easy time getting around town from the home.\n\nMy family and I would stay in this home again in a heartbeat.  It will be outstanding for any family or group of friends.  I can't imagine a better experience.  The home was the main cog in what turned out to be and incredible Thanksgiving and 60th birthday.\n\nAll in all, we had a fantastic experience."

I was very pleased with the quality and comfort of the accommodations.  The building itself is in excellent shape and what I would call a newer building.\nThe noise level was much lower than what I experience in my apartment at home.  There are a couple of busy streets outside, but other than an early morning delivery to the bakery, I slept well.  Being near the bakery was worth it though!\nThe location is great.  Most of the places I wanted to go were walkable or a short and cheap Lyft ride.\nAlicia was always one text away with any questions.  \nI loved my stay and would definitely consider this Airbnb again!  \n"

Beautiful surroundings, comfortable beds and everything we could have wanted and more. Analisa was prompt to answer any questions we had and had great tips and advice for us.

It is fine for a single person or couple, but the bedroom is tiny and has no real privacy. The bed is quite comfortable though.

Great for us to be able to relax and spend time together after a day exploring the city.  The location is also great!  A lot of local restaurants and coffee shops in the neighborhood within walking distance.  It's also just a few short minutes to downtown Seattle.\n\nElaine is also very hospitable. We were in contact at the time of booking, before arrival, and during my stay when I had questions.  She always responded quickly and had suggestions whenever I asked about things in the local area.  Anyone who rents from Elaine is going to get excellent treatment, and I highly recommend her as a host!"

Through the back, you could access the private back yard complete with outdoor furniture as well as a patio.  There was also a washer/dryer which came in super helpful for keeping clean towels on hand.\n\nOn the second level, you can find all of the other bedrooms (one with a sink) and another bathroom.  The second level was very quiet- you could not hear anything from the downstairs nor from the neighbors upstairs.\n\nThe neighborhood itself was also quiet even with the windows open all night, and super convenient!  Coffee everywhere!  We stayed for a week and could have picked a new coffee joint every day if we wanted.  The nearby street \"Broadway\" has just about every type of cuisine you could want.   There was also a grocery store (QFC) just two blocks away which was also very convenient.\n\nAnything else, such as the Convention Center, The Space Needle or Pike's Place Market was just a 5-10 minute Uber ride away =)\n\n10 out of 10, we would stay here again!"

His communication was clear and very organized. The house was great for our needs. The only thing I would mention is that the loft is finished and a great spot but its really meant for young set that can climb up and into the loft. It is not easy to get up there. We had six of us stay and that was a very full house. We used the Airstream which was a great option.  I'd love to have the whole house next time, not just the top floor. Bottom line, great location, good parking, great snacks and drinks provided by owner and comfortable beds. Really a good experience! Thanks Chris!"

The apartment was very clean, well equipped, a super cozy bed and fun kitchen for cooking.

They were not very loud as we had read in another post. Othello park isn't far which was nice, and the light rail is so convenient. We went to the tree lighting ceremony and walked home from the train. The neighborhood is very quiet. Boeing has a landing strip near by and our little guy loved seeing all the different planes in the sky. Depending who lives upstairs it can be a little loud but we had a sound machine for sleeping and it helped for the most part. It is so easy to get to west Seattle and downtown. I felt like it is a very convenient location. Columbia city was not a far drive and it had some cool shops and restaurants. We would for sure stay here again if we had the chance. "

Complex is nice and the unit was clean w/ an updated feel. Definitely worth checking out the views from the rooftop deck. Neighborhood has a lot to offer within a short walk. Would definitely stay there again. Was not a problem, but only thing that I thought was a tad odd was that the other bedroom was rented out to another airbnb guest. The host gave us a head's up about that before we arrived though and it worked out just fine."

The beds provided were more than comfortable. Everything was clean and prim, we found everything that we needed to make food for ourselves and had a really wonderful stay. \n\nThe location was amazing. It's so close to downtown, literally a 10 minutes drive or less. We had easy access to anything that we needed. \n\nOh and did I mention the rooftop view. \n\nDefinitely worth a stay from anyone who's visiting!"

The neighborhood was in a great location -- close to Fresh Flours and a very short drive from downtown. We rented a car for the trip because we visited a friend on Whidbey Island. so we never used the light rail, but my wife (originally from Seattle) noted how close we were to the station and how convenient it would be.\nCandace provided plenty of amenities - coffee, tea, honey, snacks, towels, and soaps. There were toiletry items available in case we'd forgotten a tooth brush or razor and such, and though they weren't needed it stood out to me. I appreciated her thought. Instructions were detailed and walked through the espresso maker, parking with the hang tag, trash, and just about everything involved.\nThe bed was a little uncomfortable and stiff, but not enough to compromise our overall experience."

Tree roots, as it turns out, caused major sewer backup into the house.  It was not at all Greg's fault, and he responded amazingly fast and with grace, in locating services that could find and fix the problem.  Having recently been through a similar plumbing issue of my own at home, I know it could have been long and hard.  Greg's calm but urgent responsiveness helped us get through it quickly and with as little disruption as was possible!  He did a great job of taking care of us.\n\nThe house was exceptionally clean and in great shape upon our arrival and everything worked exactly as expected.  The location is convenient - just a few minutes drive or walk to a nice restaurant / commercial streets, and easy access to some of the major roadways connecting to / from the city.  Easy 20 drive to downtown.\n\n"

We stayed in Daniella's Capitol Hill unit for 13 weeks (Oct-December) while my girlfriend worked a contract at Swedish Hospital in First Hill. The location is perfect. It's a close distance to many great neighborhoods but also in a nice quiet residential part of the city so you get the best of both world's. We walked everywhere (even Fremont sometimes). There is a garage if you need to use a car though. It's on a hill and can be a pain to back out of. I scraped the lower front portion of my car quite a bit (unavoidable) but it was very minor damage and may be minimized with a rubber strip or frame that isn't low to the ground.\n\nUpon arriving Daniella greeted us and gave us a quick walk-through and addressed any questions we had. She was quick to respond to any issues that came up through the months we were living there. The unit is split into four apartments and all the other neighbors were friendly and quiet. The shared washer and dryer is located in the basement and works well. \n\nThe apartment is fully furnished. Everything seemed recently renovated and really well kept. Internet was fast and all appliances worked well. It was the nicest short term unit we've stayed in so far. It's a professionally managed unit. We highly recommend a visit and will try to book again when we come back to Seattle. "

House rules were quite meticulous which I understand as I'd be the same for my own house; however as an Airbnb, it may be a little bit overkill. Despite so, his house is very clean and nicely renovated; this location is quite close to and from downtown via car but not as convenience without a car. \n\nWe arrived with cleaners that were still there till about 6PM which was a tad inconvenient as we didn't want to interfere by any means as a courtesy. We appreciate that Robert went out of his way to secure a cleaner so we can get the reservation but there were dirty/used dishes already in the dishwasher and there were food left in the refrigerator beforehand so with the rules. We felt that we had to document our stay to make it clear to Robert that this was not part of our stay to avoid any charges or misunderstandings. \n\nIt was a wonderful stay nonetheless.m and definitely recommend it. Thanks again Robert. "

Very convenient location.  \nTo sum up we had an outstanding trip and would stay in this condo again. "

They made it very easy for me (an East Coast transplant moving out to Seattle ahead of my fiancee) to slowly transition into Seattle. I think it took an afternoon (maybe less) to \"feel them out\" and decide that I'd definitely be comfortable staying beyond the initial month. They're friendly, super easy to talk to, and very respectful.\n\nSecond, the house is great. It's clean, warm, bright, and well laid out. An upstairs living room and adjoining kitchen are great for cooking and hanging out with Tom, Elisa, and any other guests (assuming anyone is home, which isn't always the case). The room itself is cozy with two small closets that do the job, and the private bath is a nice bonus (fear not, it has exceptional water pressure!).\n\nThird, the Greenwood neighborhood is really quite nice. It's a little quieter than Phinney or Green Lake, but it has the feel of a neighborhood that's finding it's own personality. It definitely has a chill, neighborhood vibe - but there are loads of restaurants, coffee shops, and pubs within walking distance. The Fred Meyer right around the corner is also pretty nice.\n\nI can't recommend staying here enough!\n\n\n\n\n\nLocated in the fantastic Greenwood neighborhood, it \nThe listing was spot on and the house has a very nice layout. \n"

There are spacious common areas - a kitchen on each floor and a much larger kitchen/lobby area on the first floor. The walls and floors seemed like they could have let noise through, but I wasn't disturbed by anyone else in the building or any noise from the street. "

The owner was helpful, quickly responded to questions, and very friendly. 1 King bed, 2 twin and 1 what I think was a double bed downstairs. My family was in town for Christmas to spend time with other family members that live in the area. The home and dinning room was spacious enough for us to host an enchilada dinner for our 13 person family.  This was my first experience with Airbnb and because of this owner's hospitality we are already looking at vacation homes for our next adventure."

Capitol Hill is very hip and vibrant! The unit is only a few blocks away from Broadway which is full of great shops and close to public transportation that will take you to the downtown area.\nThe unit was clean, cosy and comfortable! I would recommend Susans place whenever you're visiting Seattle for a few days and want to stay in this gorgeous neighborhood."

We had a little trouble with Chromecast and a brand new TV was installed almost immediately.  These are hosts who really care about your experience in their rental.  We love Seattle and will definitely check with Jeremy and Rachael first when we visit again. "

I found a charming house with amazing views of the lake which my house doesn\u2019t have. My older black lab was welcomed by the charming Leela and treated like a queen by her and her mistress. Even though my dog is older she was able to walk the carpeted stairs and enjoy herself in the luscious back yard. The hostess has a gift for arranging things to look aesthetically pleasing and so even though my house was good to come back to, I almost wished it wasn\u2019t. The location is peaceful, the amenities are excellent and the inconvienence was turned into a mini vacation. oh and the morning I woke up there happened to have a spectacularly beautiful sun rise I could watch from my nice warm bed."

The company and conversation were great and the whole trip was very relaxing even though I was in town for work. I appreciated the excellent breakfast, good coffee and amazing cookies! Chelsi and Jeremy are amazing entrepreneurs and will be worth watching their success in the future! I cant wait til their next venture is up, so I can visit again. It was a pleasant surprise to get the history and chemical lesson on Cannabis"

There was also a private roof deck, however  the cold weather  kept me from trying it out.    Guests are welcome to use the living room and kitchen, so I was able to cook meals. \n\nWhen I arrived, Ying met me at the light rail station. She and Jeff are truly lovely people. They no longer reside in the townhouse, but are a text away. They take very good care of their home and look out for their guests\u2019 comfort.  \n\nI wasn\u2019t familiar with the Beacon Hill neighborhood, and it turned out to be a very convenient location. A bus to downtown is a half block away and comes regularly.  The light rail station is about a 10 min. walk - and a grocery store is across the street from it.  I didn\u2019t have a car, and didn\u2019t need one at all.  \n\nI really enjoyed my stay here, and would definitely return if I need a place to stay in Seattle."

The house it a great proximity to Seattle Children's Hospital. My only complaint is that the driveway is really narrow, so rent a Mini instead of a minivan. :)"

She has all the necessary amenities (like a hair dryer), provided us bottled water, and even made us some homemade (delicious) cookies!  She greeted us when we arrived with her husband and adorable son and made us feel at home.  Great host!  Definitely recommend.  "

One night he even invited me to eat dinner with him and his friends. The meal he prepared came from the food he grew in the garden. The food was great and the company was very pleasant :) . The place itself is very creatively decorated, very clean, and in a nice, cute neighborhood. You will notice all the artistic touches from the front porch, to the inside, all the way to the backyard. Even though the street looked full of cars, I never had an issue finding parking, regardless of the time of day or night. There is a cute little park down the street that was great for yoga and hula hooping. The neighborhood also was very safe to walk in (As a woman travelling alone, I found that to be very important). I would recommend this place! Enjoy your stay :) "

The gorgeous bathroom had a shower my husband still raves about. Scott is a friendly, knowledgeable and very gracious host. His Seattle coffee was a treat every morning. This is a very charming home. The downstairs bedroom has a twin size trundle bed, which pulls out to another twin bed. The family room has a comfortable futon. The location is a short walk to West Seattle shops. You will be happy you stayed here!"

We were the first ones to use the recently renovated apartments, so I got to see both the before and after.  What a transformation!  A perfect spot for overflow guests.  Very comfortable furnishings and well-stocked kitchens.  It gave us two extra kitchens for food prep, making Thanksgiving for a large crowd easy and fun for everyone.  Very nice and quiet neighborhood with easy parking, but still close to restaurants, groceries, etc.  Andy had a welcome bag full of goodies along with a nice bottle of wine in each apartment.  I and the relatives will be return customers for sure! "

We received a pdf of instructions/how to operate the home before our arrival.  \n\nThe location was perfect.  Just a few blocks from the main drag in Fremont with tons of access to bars, restaurants, coffee, and groceries.\n\nI would highly recommend Ingrid to anyone else looking to stay in the more quiet, yet hip Fremont neighborhood.  \n"

Things were a bit out of sorts when we arrived, but a quick call to Melissa got that sorted out as she sent the cleaning guy over to handle things within 10 minutes. The bed was comfy, the view was great, and the place was nice and quiet. Overall, would definitely stay here again!"

We were fortunate to meet and spend a little time with Judith and it made our stay in Seattle even more special. You cannot go wrong booking with Judith. Her home is a quick drive/Uber/ferry to downtown Seattle with the quietness and spectacular views you will not get elsewhere. We couldn't recommend this more. Thank you for a wonderful stay, Judith!"

The room is exactly as pictured -right down to the little round pillow & throw. I didn't find a bottle of wine as some other guests have but I did find some extra complimentary toiletries in the closet that came in very handy. The room is on the small side but it is private and has great light. It's also perfectly situated between two of Seattle's best neighborhoods -Ballard and Fremont. I was able to walk to the center of both in about 15-20 minutes, while Downtown Seattle is just a short bus ride away. However, the best thing about Jason's suite is Jason. There was a  miscommunication about my arrival date and Jason wasn't ready for me when I showed up. I couldn't help but be a little worried as it was 12am in the morning and I had communicated to him that I would be arriving late. Needless to say he felt really bad about it and refunded me for the one night even though I had a perfectly sound sleep in their wonderful bed. I really appreciated that Jason took this extra step to make sure that I was comfortable and enjoyed my stay. "

It was such a treat to stay in Capitol Hill and be surrounded by such beauty. The \"apartment\" (bedroom bathroom, living area, and kitchen!) was very spacious and had everything we needed! It was extremely clean with fresh towels and shampoo, conditioner, and soap, and there were clear instructions on basic maintenance (trash, recycling, etc.) per City of Seattle rules. It is very close to a bus stop with a route directly downtown, so a rental car wasn't necessary. There is also an incredible cafe only 2 blocks away (plus busy Capitol Hill restaurants very near), and Volunteer Park is such a lovely walk only a few blocks away. It's the PERFECT location for a peaceful and fun stay in Seattle, if you want to be out of the busy downtown area. We did end up renting a car because we drove to our next destination, and parking was NO problem on Marlow's street, so know that it's a great option, too. Overall, the place was gorgeous, unique, and in a great location!"

It's tucked in the back yard of a private home, but none of the windows face any other buildings. It delivers on all three: lots of light, close access to bus line, restaurants, and shopping, and yet total privacy. It is a sturdy, beautifully designed building (I'd describe as rustic modern) with thick walls that contain sound well: blast music or shout out your creed and not be heard by neighbors. Top of the line appliances, kitchen, and bath fixtures. Lots of natural wood (butcher block kitchen counters and thick, exposed wood for loft floor which is also the kitchen ceiling). Giant ceiling fan, tank-less-on-demand-hot-water heater, skylight with a remote shade for sleeping in, and excellent light fixtures throughout. My father is an architect and I can't wait to put him up here. This place delivers a lot of simple luxuries for a very good price. The hosts, Amy and Matt have the right demeanor for Airbnb: they have a kind and easy going nature, are clear communicators, responsive to emails, calls, and texts, and are thoughtful about the details (nice towels, cutlery, kitchen ware, etc.). With kindness and good humor they set me up with everything I needed, left me alone, but were readily available when I wanted or needed to engage. You can walk down 6th Ave to Veraci Pizza or Slate Coffee shop. Walk, ride, or drive for 4 minutes over to Ballard Market to stock up the cool LG bottom-freezer fridge. I wish I could live there permanently. I will definitely be back.     "

He had everything ready for us and whenever we had any questions his response was very quick. I would definitely recommend this Airbnb apartment to anyone looking to stay in Seattle. Extremely convenient, comfortable and the communication was very strong. "

The view of Lake Union and Downtown really is spectacular ~ honestly the photos don't do it justice. \n\nThe condo is spacious, stylish, immaculately clean, and very comfortable. \n\nThe location was very special.. just a quick walk down to the Lake, or over to upper Queen Anne where theres a lots of great restaurants, bars and cafes to explore. Its a really interesting vantage to explore Seattle, very convenient to get around with a quick Uber ride.\n\nRyan is a great host ~ responsive, thoughtful, and super cool guy. He was very accommodating around check-in, and made all the details effortless. \n\nI would definitely stay again, and highly recommend!\n\n"

The condo was spotless and perfectly laid out for our family of four. It had everything we needed, a designated parking spot (very important!) and was in easy walking distance of many fantastic shops and restaurants. Best of all, when my daughter forgot her well loved blanket and bear the cleaning staff found it for us, washed it, and sent it fed-ex. This experience was really above and beyond."

The bed was huge and comfortable (a real bonus in this day and age) and the really liked having the ability to make coffee and breakfast in the mornings. The location is great as it is a very short walk to 2 great Seattle coffee shops and having Ken's Market across the street was highly convenient for them. They said it was quiet and they slept well every night. The instructions given by Michael were concise and prompt and we had no problems getting into the unit. The host also left detailed instructions in the unit about anything we might have had questions about. Our in-laws will definitely stay there again, and we will recommend this place to our own family and friends when they come to town. "

We left the car in his garage during our 3 days and walked to restaurants and shopping and parks nearby.  The view of the Olympic Mountains is really spectacular from his living room window.  Thank you Timothy and I hope we'll be able to come back again on our next Seattle visit."

We located a good coffee shop on Ranier just 3 blocks or so from the house.  The accommodations were simple (one small bedroom and an ample private bathroom) and comfortable for the two of us.  We entered via a common foyer and found their programmed front door lock to be easy to manage.  Angela's two dogs and cat were very well-mannered an not obtrusive."

She was very accommodating and respectful of our night shift schedule when doing yard work, etc. We really appreciated that! We only had 1 minor problem with the house and Grace had it repaired immediately. The house is so cute and incredibly clean! The location is awesome! It's really close to both Ballard and Fremont areas, grocery stores, gas stations, and bus stops. There is plenty of room for guests to sleep comfortably and she has provided all of the additional linens you could possibly need. The washer and dryer were in great condition as well. Grace checked on us periodically to make sure we didn't need anything. We would definitely stay with her again if we come back to town!"

For instance, the Blue Room doesn't have heating but they provided a plug-in heater, which warmed up the room nicely. You get your own cabinet space and refrigerator space to store your grocery items. Also, there is a Keriug and different types of teas in the cabinet (Earl Grey, Black Tea, Green Tea). The bed and pillows were super comfortable. The housecat, Jasper is super cute and well-behaved. I'm usually allergic to cats and dogs, however, I was not allergic to Jasper at all. Moreover, there is a beautiful bathtub downstairs for guests to use (unfortunately, I was too busy to take a relaxing bath). If you want to cook, everything you need in regards to pots/pans and utensils are provided. Roland's place is close to everything. A nice walk to Greenlake and a quick drive to neat coffee shops (Zokas and Diva Espresso), restaurants and grocery stores (QFC is five blocks away and Trader Joes is 5 minutes away). It is conveniently close to the U-district and downtown Seattle. Also, Roland is working towards a secured internet connection especially with wireless internet. Many places that offer free wifi are surprisingly not secure so Roland is actually trying to do something about it. The only downside would be you could hear people opening/closing their doors and walking up/down the stairs but I used ear plugs so it wasn't bothersome for me. Overall, I enjoyed my stay and would come back next time I'm up in Seattle."

If you have a few days a great place to go is the Boeing Factory guided tour appox 2hrs it was very interesting and there are a lot of quaint villages you can go after the tour which are on the way home.

(You've probably noticed I like to walk way too much) \n3) Miscellaneous: There is some really good restaurant in the area open late.

The actual digs are very neat, clean and modern, bed was comfy and cozy, and washroom tidy with plentiful fluffy towels. We never got to meet Sid, but the check-in process was a breeze and he was responsive and worked with us to stow our bags since our flight came in early. We definitely enjoyed our stay in Seattle and would definitely stay at Sid's listing again!"

It appeared that 2 of the bathrooms had towel racks @ 1 time but were no longer in place. The foam soap on the sink needed to be moved to bathtub for bathing. Kitchen well equipped with dishes for kids. Location is convenient for a walk or run around Greenlake. We were able to park a small truck in the garage, snug fit but nice to be inside."

From the photo, I wasn't sure if it was a separate room but was happy to see that it was which made it comfortable when other family members stopped by. The unit was easy to find and the neighborhood is great. It is well situated in an area where there are not a lot of hotels so it was very convenient to have this as a place to stay. We were free to come and go as we pleased with easy access to the unit. \n\nThe only suggestion we would have is to get a countertop microwave for the unit. There was no way to heat up water for hot tea or oatmeal and this would have been nice. (I am not a coffee drinker!) All in all, we were very pleased with our first Airbnb experience. "

Wafa has worked hard to create a peaceful, open space and she was so gracious about welcoming us and allowing us to feel like it was our home.  Her hospitality included all the comforts of home, along with special treats (chocolate!), and little notes leading the way.  She was as excited as we were to hear about our jaunts during the day and shared some aspects of what living in Seattle is like.  The home is located conveniently in a easy to access neighborhood, with coffee shops, groceries, and restaurants close at hand.   I can't say enough about how fun it was taking advantage of this great home.  We will definitely stay there in the future, provided she has openings.  Perhaps we will go dancing next time!!!  Thank you so much"

My room was as comfortable as my own home, and very much the description I saw on the site.\nBeen in the process of relocating to Seattle, Sheldon gave a lot of very useful advice from years of living in the neighbourhood and Seattle, and was always ready to listen and give guidance in my search for my own (new) home in Seattle. \n\nSheldon's place offers a home away from home and my two weeks stay there couldn't have been spent in a more comfortable place and neighbourhood. And yes, neighbourhood, his home is in a very lovely neighborhood with warm and friendly folks, and wonderful places for some good food.\nIf I ever was to use an airbnb again any where in the world, Sheldon has set the minimum standard for my expectations.\nThank you very much Sheldon, thanks for a wonderful experience in your comfortable home.\n\n- Akin.\n\n[I couldn't refer to his place other than a home, as anyting else will not dignify it.]"

She arrived early morning flight from LAX, Jon was nice enough to let her drop off luggage before our arranged check in time.  Had great stay and Jon was available via text/email during our stay.  Would def stay here again for another trip to Seattle.  "

As a family unit, it was great to have the playroom with toys and books.  We especially liked the master bedroom and the main bathroom.  The extra touches of fresh coffee beans and Pike Street Market tea, the organic scented hand soap and body lotion were very nice.  We used the kitchen so the plentiful cooking/eating dishes really helped.  Weather didn't permit us to enjoy the garden, but loved seeing the carrots still growing!\n\nBoth the owners and the house manager were super attentive.  They checked in with us and responded to a phone call question within minutes.  Thanks for all of that.  It was a great place to stay."

We were out looking for apartments in the area, only slept here 2 of the 3 night stay, and only for a couple of hours each night as we were on more of a itinerary and not a vacation. We did feel a little out of place, but, they were nice enough. Very nice home & the location is perfect if you're doing anything in the Seattle area."

        "comments": "This was my first bad experience renting an Airbnb after many great experiences. First the host required that I schedule a time to let me into the Airbnb even though they have an electronic door code which is an unnecessary hassle. This was because they wanted to me to sign a separate contract and take my credit card info. This is not allowed by the Airbnb TOS, hosts can require a separate contract *only if* they publish it on their listing so guests can review it before paying. This host had not published the contract and threatened to not let me stay until I signed (which I did not want to do). It was a very frustrating and stressful way to start a long (10 day) stay.\n\nThe apartment was nice enough otherwise, it would have been a good stay if it hadn't started out in such a bad way."

The apt is fantastic. I slept on the couch bed and I have to say it is more comfortable than I thought, because the heater is just in front of the couch bed. Our family cooked twice in the apt and we find everything we need to cook - from cookware to seasoning. The place is in the best location to tourism places as well as to the supermarket. The only thing I think should be better is the parking place. We spend more than $50 in three days. I hope Zvi can help people to find cheaper parking space in the future. "

But the same feeling as other reviewers, we were surprised at how steep the stairs are to get to the home and they could use some additional lighting and maintenance for safety. (it is a little bit slippery after the rain and I had to use phone lighting at night) Thus for any one with heavy luggage, I would suggest thinking before booking.  Also, since we came during winter time, the \"basement\" bedrooms seemed too freezing. We even set the air conditioner to 80 one night, but still, we felt so cold downstairs. And the hot water turned cold suddenly one time when I was taking a shower. It is not a big deal if it is in Summer, but with the freezing room temperature, it is not a pleasant thing.\n\nOverall, we love her home. The neighborhood is quite and safe and it is close to tourists attractions and cafes. With this reasonable price, we can just bear the cold water etc."

The neighborhood has coffee in abundance, a short walk away. The bus stop is also very close. There is a binder full of information and Steve made sure we could reach him if needed (which we didn't). The bathroom has a heated floor which was an unusual and nice touch. As mentioned in the write up, there is an on-street parking spot for your use.  Due to the narrow streets in the area, I would recommend against having a large vehicle (which isn't a great idea in Seattle anyway)."

In other words, we spent a lot of time living in the space, using the kitchen, and hanging out. The place was PERFECT for our family holiday! Susan was also very quick to respond to our questions."

        "comments": "My four days in Seattle were most wonderful. I used to live in the city, and have family and friends there, so it's rare I would turn to an Airbnb listing for accommodation, but in this instance it made the most sense. Abby's suite was everything I needed, and then some, making my stay in Seattle warmer and drier, the perfect place to retire for quiet and a peaceful sleep. Proximity to everything the charming Madrona neighborhood has to offer was ideal. Great cafes, restaurants, coffeeshops, and more can be found either within a brief walk or drive, and it's a lovely area to just walk around in, period. With a rental car and GPS, it was no problem getting to other parts of the city, as well. Abby was friendly and helpful when I reached out, and gave me plenty of privacy otherwise. And then there was that view! In the morning, whether cloudy and rainy, or during a clear sky respite, waking up to the sunrise across Lake Washington and points eastward kind of made my day.  I would happily stay here again, and definitely recommend it to others who want to feel at home in a great Seattle location."

Although it is a studio and is somewhat small there is everything you need in the apartment including a full kitchen and a large closet for hiding luggage. The bed was so comfortable I wanted to sleep all day! The bathroom was very very well stocked with boutique shampoo and conditioners fancy soaps and really good hair dryer and straightener available for use! The apartment was well heated and the kitchen had a huge selection of gourmet teas! I used the washer dryer located in the basement which was coin operated and Elena had detergent in the apartment available for a small fee. She also provided a parking spot next door for a small fee which was so convenient! I would absolutely stay here again for the amazing location. The only drawback was the noise. Sometimes planes could be heard overhead or neighbors conversations from other units. It did not keep me from falling asleep though and still for the price and location it is unbeatable! \nElena was available instantly by text and the instructions she provided were perfect! She even recommended a local Packer bar for me and my boyfriend to watch our favorite team as soon as we landed in Seattle! "

Only complaint is that wifi was almost nonexistent, and the bars downstairs can be pretty loud late at night, but if I was in town for fun and not work neither would have bothered me. "

The Upper Queen Anne neighborhood is one of the best in the city: beautiful family houses with gardens and many views of the city below, mountains in the distance and water all around (Puget Sound on one side, Lake Union on the other). The place is within a walking distance from stores, art and fitness studios and parks. \nI would recommend this place to my friends and family and I hope to be back at Barbara\u2019s next time we come to Seattle.\n"

When we arrived we immediately felt at home. Since we were staying for a month, it was great to be in such a cozy, well decorated and well supplied space. We had all the kitchen items we needed and then some, very easy access to laundry and a comfortable living room. Lastly,  Jennifer and Phil were always incredibly responsive and proactive with any issues.  \n\nWe also enjoyed the neighborhood greatly. It's very easy access to the Junction in West Seattle as well as buses downtown. We will miss this space very much and would highly recommend it for a longer stay or a short trip. "

        "comments": "The location of the unit couldn't have been more perfect for our weekend stay! Plenty in walking distance and close to the friends we were visiting. \n\nUnfortunately the customer service we received was sub-par. To be clear, this review is not for David, the host that is listed for this unit, but for Pillow, the service that runs the booking, communication and accommodations for this listing via David's account. It started when I booked the unit -- we were only going to be in town for two nights. This was an Instant Book, so I got a confirmation right away. Pillow then contacted me and tried to tell me it was a three night minimum, even though the Airbnb listing clearly said two. After several phone calls and messages, we were able to keep our reservation of only two nights, luckily. It was just a hassle, especially considering my card had already been charged. \n\nWhen we arrived, the unit was clean and as expected based on the photos. The problem was that the bed on the loft didn't have a comforter. There were no extra blankets anywhere in the unit either. There isn't a phone number to contact Pillow, but I left a message through Airbnb and they let me know that they could deliver one but that it would be an extra charge. We decided against paying more than what we had paid already. After we'd checked out, David (the actual host) messaged me and let me know there should have been a comforter on each of the beds. Unfortunately Pillow operates strictly and couldn't provide more than sheets and towels without an extra charge, even though it sounded like David would have.\n\nWe asked for an hour late check out, which wasn't granted. Not a big deal, but just sort of confirmed the feeling on this trip that Pillow operates like a robot host and it certainly took away some of the charm I've experienced on stays at other rentals. \n\nAgain, the unit and location are great! If you're not worried about the level of service you'll get from Pillow then this is a great spot to be for 2-4 people. "

There are most of the amenities that you would need including a refrigerator, working stove, and wi-fi. Upon arrival there were great beverages and a snack waiting to greet me. If you don't mind going into someone's home to use the shower and restroom, the home is clean and inviting. I felt safe traveling alone here. Alvin was a wonderfully accommodating host. My only issue was the heating. I chose to stay in a season when it was 25 degrees at night. This RV is uninsulated and the only heat source is a propane space heater. I had to wake every few hours to reload a new barrel of propane. I also didn't realize until the second night that it's not safe to heat a small enclosed space with a propane space heater unless you ventilate it, at which point I let all of the heat out. If you plan ahead to bring an electric blanket and/or if maybe they update the space heater to an electric one I think this could easily be a four or five star 'glamping' experience. I imagine in the spring, it's a dream."

She was very responsive with my messages as my flight landed at 10:30am in Seattle. It was very easy to find & only s short was from the light rail station from 5th. Even in the rain it was easy to find! The building is beautiful with all the right amenities. The apt itself is\nAs it was in the pictures. An amazing view.. Every room was very clean. The sheet were a  little hard and crisp.. Probably very new. But still s very inviting and comfortable apt to stay in. Everything was within walking distance. And Sarah was very accommodating to us as my boyfriend and I got sick on our trip and needed a little more time to check out. The concierge staff was very nice and we definitely will use Sarah again if we are ever back in Seattle. "

The bed was very comfortable and there were extra blankets available to counter the winter cold. I enjoyed playing CDs on the Bose Surround Sound system in the bedroom. The bathroom was upstairs, but private and had a luxurious jacuzzi tub which I had the pleasure of soaking in. All the supplies were top quality, such as special soaps, shampoos, etc. Even the toilet paper was soft and thick. The house was a nicely decorated heritage home in a great location. I will likely be returning in the months ahead on future visits. It would have been very comfortable for 2 people."

The room was a good size to share and the private balcony was a plus! We never met Sarah during our stay but she was very responsive when I messaged her. Her other roommate Kim was very nice and welcoming. Would definitely recommend this groovy artist studio to anyone who wants a relaxing stay in Seattle!"

We couldn't have asked for a better set-up and they have been accommodating  to our needs above and beyond expectations. We will be staying quite a bit more in future. The Wedgewood community where the house is located is walkable and family-friendly. We regularly strolled the local streets and the house is walking distance from stores, coffee shops, cafes and a wide variety of beautiful green spaces. With an easy commute to downtown Seattle, the Tiny House is not to be missed! We want to have our own Tiny House some day so the stay has allowed us to explore the Tiny life before making commitments toward our own home. With all the luxuries needed for a cozy stay (including the easy and low-maintenance composting toilet) we highly recommend this place to any and all! \n\nLiz and Brooke "

Very clean with bamboo floors, granite countertop, light carpet upstairs.  Bed was very comfortable.  Our concerns about the availability of on street parking near the condo were unfounded,  spaces usually available right in front of condo, pull into drive to load/unload, park on street.   Ample space in closet and refrigerator, we traveled too \"heavy\" and appreciated the room.  We stayed for 8 days,  a very nice place to live while visiting the area.  "

We drove a very large Ford Expedition and had no trouble whatsoever parking in our own off-street space.  We arrived late at night, and really appreciated the exterior lighting and the toasty warm apartment.\n\nThe furnishings, towels and linens are extremely high quality, the shower gets very hot quickly and has great water pressure, and the gas stove, quality knives and cookware were a pleasure to use.  The clothes washer and dryer have a large capacity, and both complete a load on regular cotton settings in under an hour.  The neighborhood is high class, very safe, and very quiet.  We slept quite well in the comfortable bed, thanks especially to a selection of very nice pillows.  The wifi internet reaches all corners of the apartment, at speeds of at least 30Mbps.\n\nThe attention to detail is excellent.  For example, much of the floor is an attractive tile, and comfy disposable slippers were provided so we did not need to wear socks (or shoes) to keep our feet warm.  Pauline and this apartment are an unbeatable combination, and we would love to stay here again!\n"

We decided not to stay when we saw that the room was small and dark, next to the shared kitchen and bathroom. There were more people staying in the house than we expected, making the small, over-furnished space claustrophobic. Handwritten signs everywhere and odor of cat box contributed to the unpleasant feel of the house. The advertised hot tub was without water and clearly hadn't been used in a while."

The place is also fairly close to downtown (~12 min driving). We were able to fine everything we needed when we arrived, and Walter was able to assist us through the phone when needed. I would highly recommended anyone to stay here."

It seemed to have everything needed to make us feel at home, including fresh fruit and the essentials for breakfast.  Tina is a good communicator, greeted us warmly, and was sure that all was in order for a perfect stay."

I was in Seattle as a nursing student finishing up a clinical intensive, so it was lovely to be able to stay at a place where I could be as outgoing, or as focused on schoolwork as I wanted. Jessica and Jonathan were very welcoming, and very laid-back. They made sure my stay was going well, checked to see if there was anything else I needed. I appreciated being able to use the kitchen as much as I wanted. \nFor people who are more introverted, this is a great place because the house is so big. \nFor those who are more social, this is a great area as well. Ravenna and the surrounding districts have so many great restaurants and activities. \nI should add that they have three very sweet dogs that love to play and cuddle. I loved having the dogs around, but for people who are not fans of animals, this is probably not the best place. \n The dogs sometimes bark, but this was not an issue for me, even when I was working night shift and sleeping during the day. They did not wake me up either due to the fan I had on or due to sheer exhaustion. "

It is within walking distance of cafes, restaurants and even Trader Joe's!  It is close to the fun Fremont area (lots of breweries) and some great running spots - Lake Union and Green Lake.  Their place is modern, clean and cozy.  I enjoyed sitting on the porch overlooking Lake Union and enjoying the city sounds and lights at night.  Both Kelsey and Wes were extremely attentive and helpful while I was staying at their place.  I would highly recommend this spot to all travelers.  "

It's a lot smaller than the pictures let on, the cleaning crew was not done by check-in time, and there's cosmetic damage to the paint and furniture that resulted in paint chips on the floor. If this is your first time in Seattle, this location is fantastic as it's within walking distance of a lot of big downtown Seattle attractions (Pike's Place market, Space Needle, Starbucks Reserve Tasting Room, several bars, underground tour, etc.)"

There are restaurants and a small neighborhood shopping area on Greenwood Avenue which is about a half mile away.  The room was really nice, clean, had flannel sheets, with a thick comforter, and blanket.  This made sleeping really nice.  There was plenty of closet space, and she put out soap and shampoo for me to use on arrival.  Elizabeth is a generous host, and is very sincere in her care for the individual staying with her.  She allowed use of her washing machine, and everything was neat, clean, and tidy.  I would stay with her again when I travel to Seattle.  "

The apartment is literally steps from the beach with immediate access to the multi-use Alki trail, picnic/barbecue/bonfire facilities, and a variety of cafe's, bars, and restaurants.  Alki Beach is a charming town in West Seattle that appeals to families and people of all ages.  The Alki trail is a flat, coastal, multi-use trail that is easy to bike and offers beautiful views of downtown and the harbor.  \nKris is a very accommodating and generous host.  She provided me with a key for 24 hour access, kitchen and laundry privileges, and a comfortable couch for sleeping.  It is a one bedroom, one bathroom, basement level apartment, probably 1970's era, with a combined living/kitchen space so there is no real expectation of privacy but Kris is very respectful of the shared space and really extends herself on behalf of her guest.  I walked to the water taxi (about 1/2 hour walk) to access downtown Seattle but there is also a bus stop on the corner so a car is not necessary. \nThis was both my first Airbnb booking and my first couch surfing experience so I had some trepidation about safety.  I took a chance based on positive earlier reviews and a willingness to lose my money and bail out if I didn't feel safe.  Needless to say, there are no worries on that account.  Kris offers a sweet deal if you want to be in West Seattle to enjoy a beach experience and really just need a safe, comfortable space to land at night."

It's also very well connected with bus lines and close to freeways.\n\nThis house would be a little tricky for those with mobility issues as there are lots of stairs and you have to park about a block away. It is no problem to drop someone off in the alley in the back of the house as we did my Grandmother when she came to visit. You can also park close to load and unload.

We were visiting Seattle from Portland  for a little sight seeing, and we could easily walk to all the major sights from the unit. After a day of walking around, it was nice to come back to our room for a glass of wine and nice views, and then walk to one of the many nearby restaurants. My daughters also enjoyed a dip in the swimming pool. The only real downside for us (as a family of four) is that the unit was a little cramped for four people. It is a studio with a queen bed and a sofa bed. We actually didn't try the sofa bed as we had brought an airbed with us which worked okay, although the airbed took up most of the floor space in the apartment."

The location was amazing, with great street parking, 1 block to easy downtown bus, a fabulous Cuban restaurant across the street, and cute shops/nice market within easy walk. And the lake! What a fun place to walk and people watch! Keith was very kind, making sure we had umbrellas, and all questions answered.  I can't imagine a better place in Seatle!"

The suite was well-stocked with amenities, including snacks, bottled water, a mini-fridge and a Keurig coffee maker. Check-in was simple thanks to a keypad entry - we didn't even need to coordinate a meeting with the host. The location of the studio is fantastic for visiting Seattle. The immediate Columbia City neighborhood is bustling with a wide variety of restaurants and a great market, and the studio's proximity to the LINK (Seattle's light rail system) makes it super easy to head north into the downtown core or south to Sea-Tac airport (if you flew into town), with trains every 10 mins. We'd definitely stay here again in the future."

Then we go up to a beautiful, clean, and well-appointed 2 bedroom, 2 bath condo just as described.  It was perfect for our family of 5.  There was one little hiccup when we almost ran out of toilet paper (no extra rolls were provided as promised), but I called the very nice customer service rep at 9 pm and it was easily taken care of the next morning.  We had everything we needed to make our stay comfortable.  Overall, we can confidently recommend and look forward to staying here on our next trip to Seattle.  Thank you!"

I was initially looking specifically downtown  Seattle location but could not find available dates.\n\nOnce Amazing Ballard was booked, Jeremy was quick to confirm stay for the minimum 3-nights.    And Jeremy kept in contact to check up on us to assure we were doing okay.  My wife and daughter equally loved the space and the location...we did not want to leave!\n\nThere was some street noise being right on hustling 15th Ave., but the location was a short drive to downtown and the Rapid D-Line stop was just across the street.  We felt safe in the unit with a secured building entrance; electronic codes to the building and unit worked flawlessly...no keys necessary.\n\nThe description of the interior space was right on the mark to include hotel like linens, bedding type and kitchen was well stocked.  The d\u00e9cor was stylish; inviting and warm and extremely tidy.\n\nJeremy's recommendations on where to dine and locale of grocery stores and other services was extremely helpful.  We loved Un Bien a short walk away and the street parking was never a problem on 75th.\n\nI would return to Ballard without hesitation as Jeremy was an A+ host.  I could not have asked for a better 1st Airbnb experience :-) "

She even provided a wonderful gift basket (with a bottle of wine and snacks/treats) and toiletries along with a list of suggestions of what to see/eat in the neighborhood. \n\nAs for the house, it was simply incredible! It is a historic Queen Anne home that was even more beautiful in person than the Airbnb photos suggest, and it very comfortably accommodated our group of seven people. In terms of location, the house is steps away from many great Queen Anne Hill restaurants and walking distance from many attractions in Seattle (e.g., Pike Place Market, Seattle Center, downtown Seattle). It is also a short drive/bus ride from Green Lake, the University District, and Capital Hill.\n\nOverall, a fantastic stay!"

Located on a quiet No Outlet street, the home blends the charm only older homes can have, with perfect updating of critical portions that results in the perfect Meritage of homes.\nCarter, while not on site, is an attentive host, but never intruding on your privacy.  A strong plus:  The property was as described.\nTop all the amenities, such as a well equipped kitchen, great master bath, views of the Sound that include watching the ferries come and go, skies changing moods as the day progresses, and the result is a comfortable retreat for romantics of all ages.  \nDo not hesitate to book this gem.\n\n"

He responded quickly to messages.\nBesides being an urban, modern showpiece, the home was clean, comfortable and spacious. It was everything that was promised. The bed was superb, the shower was hot. We slept soundly in this quiet neighborhood. \nThe location was within easy walking distance to good food and coffee. There is great fun to be had in Ballard.\nParking was always easy."

We would definitely stay there again if the opportunity arises.  Kim and her husband put a lot of intention behind the design of their beautiful home, making it a welcoming and serene environment.  While it's not a large home, it feels spacious and the view is expansive. We had plenty of space for our family of four. The house is uncluttered, very clean, and well organized.  Everything is thoughtfully placed.  We had plenty of drawer and closet space which helped make us feel right at home.  When we arrived we were greeted by a kind note, cookies, a list of child friendly attractions in the area, directions for how to work all the gadgets in the house, and toys set aside for our children.  It was easy to be there, especially with children.  When not out and about in Seattle, we spent time relaxing and enjoying the incredible view while our children played with toys inside and outside (in the very private back yard).  The house is well child proofed so we felt we really could relax.  The kitchen was well equipped and easy to navigate.  We were able to cook many of our meal\u2019s at home. Kim's home is VERY conveniently located, so we also enjoyed many family restaurants, mostly in Ballard and Queen Anne.  Overall, it's a really special place.  We highly recommend this spot whether you have children or not.  "

Khadija was very helpful answering all of our questions promptly and making the apartment ready before our arrival. In addition to 1 bed that mentioned in the listing, she provided a comfortable air mattress and plenty of blankets for all three of us. The apartment is in great location; space needle few blocks away and pike market is 10 min by bus. The apartment is clean, impeccably organized just to make you feel like home. Khadija was also flexible about arrival/departure time and that helped us to drop our luggage at the apartment then to go out exploring the city. Overall, very nice experience as a first Airbnb guest and thanks to Khadija to make it possible. "

The apartment itself is fairly well-lit, had plants indoors, and was cozy. We had four people during our stay, so the space was a little tight for us and our suitcases. However, we were able to make it work. Duncan is extremely responsive to communication and he is very proactive in checking up on the experience of your stay, which we are grateful for. The apartment also has a TV and gaming consoles, which were a nice touch. The beds were soft. The main drawback of the location is that it is small, but since the four of us were out and about during the day, it did not matter too much. The apartment is very well-located, as it is a block away from a larger street. It is a short 3-minute walk from Volunteer Park, and a 10-minute walk to a supermarket. Overall, I'd recommend this place if you had 3 to 4 people and expect to be using this space only for sleeping. "

The apartment was very clean, spacious and the bed was super comfortable and you got all ameneties such as dishwasher, laundry and a nice bathtub! \n \nAlso, its located in great neighborhood with cafes and walkble distance to downtown and Capitol hills restaurants, pubs and cafes. Major buslines going about anywhere is just around the corner.\nWe would recommend this apartment to anyone and it suited us prefect to stay there with our son. Also parking was not a problem. \n\nWe loved the unique and artistic touch of the house, it was very inspiring and such a great and comfortable house to stay in. Danielle and Andrew made us feel very at home being very generous with things that we could borrow such as picknick equipment and they had a lot of fresh fruit, juice and other great food left for us! We loved staying at their house and we would definitely stay here again when visiting Seattle!! This is truly a pearl!   \n\n   "

I only had the pleasure of meeting Grace, she was very warm and welcoming! I barely heard a peep from them or neighbours considering it's an old building. They had a beautiful home, with everything you could need for a visit to Seattle including a welcome package of recommendations! The house is a thoughtfully put together home with beautifully personal touches which was comforting to me as I was a little homesick being so far from home. Felt more like visiting a friends place! Perfect location to walk, ride or bus to downtown, Capitol Hill or CenturyLink (where I spent most of my time during my visit). Everything was clean and dust free. The bed was huge and super comfortable and the shower was great (things I usually miss about being at home, but not at Grace and Jareds)!"

Space is super walkable to public transportation and also close to the convention centre (it's near the community college, so there was good restaurants around as well). Great for a couple or a single if you don't mind the sound of turtles swimming around a tank. :)"

The home has a very warm,  comfortable feel with a spacious, modern kitchen great for cooking.  Due to the weather we did not use the outdoor space, but this is a very nice space. Josh and Joanne were very accommodating in allowing us to check in early.  There are a couple of things that should be addressed for future guests.  One is the AV system. The AV system is not at all user friendly, the WIFI did not work well and we had a difficult time throughout our stay getting TV stations.  The listing says 4 bedrooms / accommodates 8.  There are 4 bedrooms but one is set up as an office without a bed.  "

The neighborhood is nice, quiet and safe. Restaurants and grocery stores are 5-8 minutes away (by car).  This location is right outside the city of Seattle so you will need to drive but not that far.  There are malls and additional restaurants 15 minutes south of this place.

Living room is inviting, but bathroom definitely is not and is very small.  Although clawtooth tub is charming, it is awkward to get into, find a place for your soap, etc.  Not a big deal, but just realize that is part of the deal with this otherwise excellent accommodations.  I'd stay here again."

The family respected my privacy and allowed me to set the tone for how much I wanted to interact. The space itself is just like the pictures and well cared for. The kitchen, lounge area and bathroom are shared space with other potential renters. I don't think that was clear to me when I originally looked at the room. It's a good idea to ask if anyone else will be occupying the space while you are there. I had no problem with sharing the space, my roommates were friendly and respectful. The location is close to several bus routes as described, but it is a decent distance from downtown. You have to take a 30 min bus ride if you plan to travel to the U-district or downtown. I would recommend staying at Siri's airbnb and I would consider staying there again for future trips. However, I would advise you to speak with Siri first and discuss the schedule of her family and the other possible renters in advance. At times there can be a lot going on so you should be fully prepared for that ahead of time. \n"

The neighborhood has a few great restaurants within walking distance or a quick drive (or steep climb!) up to Queen Anne. You're also in easy walking distance of much of downtown and South Lake Union. Would highly recommend Brooke's place. She is also extremely responsive if you need anything.   "

Magnolia is a fabulous community just outside Seattle, and we found it warm and inviting. The short car/bus drive downtown (...buses easily accessible) was not a problem. In fact the bus ride really made it part of the total Seattle experience.  In regards to the home/retreat we booked, we found it nothing short of exceptional. Very large bedrooms with comfortable beds, great game room, and a lot of common areas to just sit, relax and enjoy a glass of wine. And we were told that a kitchen is currently being added, which will be a real bonus the next time we stay. House/retreat has a deck that wraps across the entire back with a wonderful view of downtown Seattle. It was actually quite stunning to watch the sun come up across the city in the morning, and then to see the bright lights of the city at night. And as for our host, Karin was as exceptional as the home and city views. A very lovely lady that you can tell loves Seattle almost as much as hosting her guest. Karin's knowledge of Magnolia and Seattle made our travels and stay that much easier. A wonderful Seattle experience that we will highly recommend to our family and friends, and one that we will again be taking soon!"

Seth left very detailed instructions on how to operate all the appliances, etc. Without traffic, it's only about 15 minutes to drive downtown, so it's pretty convenient. There is parking in the driveway, but street parking seems to get tight at night, so only count on one space for sure. The wifi, the heating, and the kitchen appliances all worked well, and the place has clearly been renovated during the past several years. There are three bedrooms and a convertible sofa. We didn't use the roof, but there are chairs and a table there (no barbecue that I could find). Seth was responsive to our text messages, and although we didn't meet him, a professional host."

Our trip to Seattle was to spend the Christmas holiday with our children.  Our plan included preparing a Christmas dinner for the family (five of us) at the Airbnb location.  \n\nThe kitchen was VERY cook friendly and since I was cooking major meals, I appreciated that.\n\nThe location is great; quiet, with plenty of safe street parking.  We could walk just a few blocks to Lake Washington and enjoy the hiking path as well as waterfront.\n\nVeronica was very prompt in addressing all of my questions.  It was a joy to meet her and I would pronounce our stay a huge success.\n\nThank you Veronica!"

Close to Green lake which is a great walk and definitely go to Duke's for wonderful chowder and seafood. Highly recommend \nSheila"

I would definitely recommend Adam as a host and his Capitol Hill apartment as a great location for a few days in the Emerald City. "

She went above and beyond to make sure we had everything from check in to check out. She made sure to be available for any questions we had! She was extremely friendly, courteous, and welcoming. Caren told us everything about the surrounding areas, where everything is, and all the tourist attractions. \n\nThe listing was very accurate! What I liked about the neighborhood was that it was in the center of everything. Just like Caren described, Pikes Place was a block away, the art museum was around the corner. Everything was within walking distance. The neighborhood felt safe enough to walk by yourself. "

Walking into the apartment was amazing, there were flowers, fruits, an umbrella, coffee, etc etc....so much more! We felt so welcomed. Every single room had ALL of the amenities that we needed. The location itself is close to everything, Pike Market Place, Space Needle, International District, University district, Shopping mall, Everything! The walk to Green Lake was only 2 blocks away. Finding parking on the street was never a problem. I'm sure there is tons more postive feedbacks that I have forgotten. Point is we are already thinking about our next trip and staying here again! Thank you Jim for everything! We had a lovely stay. \n\nKimi"

The manager, Autumn was very helpful, communicated well and was there to meet us on arrival and walk us through the apartment. \n\n Fremont is a fun location to stay in while visiting Seattle. convenient and safe.\n"

It is only a couple of minutes from the Space Needle and the Paul Allen Music Experience and only a few more minutes to downtown. There are very good restaurants, bars/pubs and grocery stores in the immediate vicinity. This is an older residential section of town with narrow streets. The only heads up I would give someone staying here is that traffic during morning/afternoon rush hours can be very hectic and should be avoided if you are renting a vehicle. \nJeremy met us at our arrival and made us feel very welcome. I definitely recommend staying at Le Penthouse!"

But there is a 24h door man always there to greet and help which is nice when arriving late.  The neighbourhood is fantastic! Walking distance from the football game.  Great bars and restaurants all around.  Really an excellent location.  Check in was a little interesting since the owner was to email us 5 days prior with instructions to check in and I received no email.  So while driving from had to email and then call owner to get info. But after calling I did get info right away it just cost data and airtime. Check out was simple and uneventful with doorman. Parking wasn't cheap around there and this unit didn't mention any offers of parking.  So may want to add about $20-40 for the cost of parking overnight depending on how often you will move your car.  Street parking works fine if you're willing to wake up and move it to avoid tickets etc.  That was free overnight I believe."

While we didn't get a chance to meet Jimmy when we arrived as he was out of town, he was easy to communicate with and quick to respond to emails. He also prepared a thorough list of his House Manual which made everything easy. Thank you, Jimmy! :)"

The photos are representative (with the exception of the two with the orange wall, which must be another property?), but the couch and shower curtain have been updated.  It was wonderful to have a full kitchen, and washer and dryer.  We did not have any trouble with entry/exit instructions, as David made it all clear.  The parking space was tight, but that is pretty standard at these sorts of complexes.  While there was a bit of road noise from the street directly out front, it did not bother us.  We're from a big city and are used to some noise, so neither of us used the earplugs that were provided for guests.  We loved being so near to the Myrtle Edwards State Park, which has  a lovely trail along the water for running/walking/cycling.  When the weather was nice, we walked to Pike's Place Market, to the Seattle Center, and to restaurants and bakeries in the neighborhood.  We definitely plan to stay here again, next time we visit Seattle, and we'll recommend it to our friends.  "

We were a group of 7 adults and there was more than enough room and beds to comfortably accommodate all of us. There is a driveway for parking, and check in was simple, as Conan was good with communication over Airbnb. We just had to make our own beds, where the sheets were conveniently placed in cubby holes in each room. The only risk is that the state of the house upon check in is based on how well the previous group of guests clean up after themselves. Conan did send a message regarding the cleanliness though, so I'm sure he would have rectified the situation had it not been clean. We would stay here again :)"

The apartment is in a great location, within walking distance to lots of restaurants, bars, coffee shops and grocery stores.. Downtown is 10 minute drive or 30 minutes of easy walking. We especially appreciate the option of having a parking space reserved at a reasonable fee. We would definitely recommend this place to anyone visiting Seattle."

We shared the beds. Previous reviews about the noise from the street are accurate. The condo is on the 3rd floor and 1 bedroom faces a main busy street, so you can hear a lot noise late into the night. Check-in and check-out was very easy. \n\nI would recommend this condo to anyone visiting Seattle, or if you're working downtown. "

The roomy king sized bed was very comfortable and nicely made up with a bathroom directly across the hall. It was a bit spendy for the apartment unless location, location, location is your main concern. If you want to walk to Green Lake, Starbucks, some nice restaurants and shops this is close to them all. Our experience is positive and would recommend it as a clean, safe place to stay around Green Lake. There is parking although it's a little tight if you have anything larger than our Rav4."

There were only a couple of people there when I was there. I stayed in a basement room. There was a bathroom on the same floor but the kitchen was upstairs. There was a minifridge by the room. The basement has a private side entrance that they recently added a keycode deadbolt in. The door to the room itself wasn't that great, it didn't feel very secure but I had the only key and nothing was taken. The neighborhood is nice, it was a short bus ride away from the university and hospital so it was what I needed. The room itself was unremarkable, it is as pictured with a full size bed. The room had a peculiar odor that reminded me of cat litter and felt damp at times. I asked for air freshener and was told to buy some at the local store. My stay had ups and downs and I can't say that I would do it again given the choice. The bathroom shower was short and cramped and the smell was off putting. However given the location it suited my needs. "

It actually worked out just fine since our flight was changed and our arrival to Seattle was delayed by a few hours.  I did receive all of the info I needed via E prior to our arrival.   The welcome packet was detailed and very handy.   It gave us all of the details we needed.  \n\nThe property itself was great.  The location was perfect: right downtown in the middle of all of the oceanfront/downtown action.  The staff at the desk were very friendly and helpful.  We were on the 6th floor with a corner condo.  The furnishings were comfy and clean, as were all of the linens.  The snack basket was nice and the kitchen was just the right size.  We didn't do much outside of sleep there as we spent most of our time out and about.  There were no noise issues and the view of the waterfront and wheel was just right.    \nI would recommend this place to my friends and would stay there again should we need two bedrooms.  It's perfect for visitors who want to be downtown and within walking distance to the sites in that area.          "

It's 1 mile south of Green Lake.  Total distance to and around the lake and back is 5.5 miles. If it rains outside you can walk to the neighborhood gym 1 block away from Sandy's house and they charge $20 for a day pass or $50 for a week.  Awesome newer gym with nice equipment.  Sandy has plenty of street parking even in Seattle which is unique.  Her location is ideal because it's close to both 99 and I-5.  Getting around is a breeze. Sandy is a great find."

I didn't get the chance to meet Vivian personally, but her boyfriend and their friend welcomed me. The room was very clean and the place has a full kitchen that you could use. \n\nAt first, I was disappointed that this place doesn't have a private bathroom which was different from the listing description. I knew this after I requested to book. One night, at around midnight, it was extremely loud that I couldn't sleep since Oscar and his friend were playing xbox until like 1am with a loud shouting. I felt like I am staying at college dorm :-(  Since I had to work, I wished it was more quiet at night and they were more considerate to guests. Another thing was that I had to call someone (their friend) to enter the house each time. Hope these are things that future guests might want to know before booking, and I hope Vivian and her friends who stay there can improve!  "

The unit is walking distance to Pike Place and downtown shopping, which was decorated for Christmas and really brought a nice touch to our amazing trip to Seattle.   \n\nThe unit was comfortable and has everything we needed.   The kitchen was equipped if we wanted to cook our own meals, but we chose to instead eat out at the many good  restaurants that are in the immediate area.  The beds are comfortable.  Apartment is clean and well maintained.  Having the washer and dryer in the unit is convenient and helps if you don't want to overpack for an extended stay.  \n\nWe would definitely stay here again.

Although there are a few busy streets nearby and we weren't sure how quiet the house would be, my fears were gone as soon as we stepped into the apartment. It was beautifully clean, simple, and quiet. I loved the care and artfulness of the space. It was just personal enough to to feel cozy without feeling like we were invading someone's home. We appreciated the coffee, tea, and chocolate that Manuela left- just right for coming down from travel abc launching off to the next adventure. The neighborhood seemed great, though there wasn't time for us to explore Frenont. "

The condo was spacious, thoughtfully appointed and very close to many tourist attractions. If you turned left on Pike Road, the Convention Center was a few blocks away and Pikes Place was a little further down the road. Turn right and you were a few blocks away from the Starbucks Tasting Room and Melrose Market( filled with wonderful sandwich, cheese, wine and flower shops and a butcher. Nordstrom, Macy's and the Monorail were also within walking distance. We had a fabulous family adventure in Seattle and highly recommend this condo to anyone looking for a true city experience."

I still went forward with the reservation since it was in a great location in Belltown.  Meg and Amanda were very accommodating and very nice.  The parking was the biggest issue since they only allow 4 hour time slots and you cannot pay ahead of time so we had to come back every 4 hours to refill the meter until after 8pm on Saturday & Sunday is free.  The best thing about the place was it was very clean and it was walking distance to everything like Pike's Market, Space Needle, and tons of restaurants/bars nearby!  "

The Seattle Art Museum and Benaroya Hall are also nearby.  It was easy walking to Belltown or Pioneer Place.  The International District and Seattle Center are a little further walk or a short ride.  Parking was included which is a bonus if you want to roam further afield.  \n\nCommunication through airbnb was easy, and Emma provides a packet with all the info you need.  As might be expected downtown, space is at a premium, and the closets are already filled.  Wifi was easy.  Cable/satellite tv but only public stations available; the door was drafty, but then I wasn't in Seattle to sit around and watch tv."

The facilities where very good (nice coffee machine). \n\nLocation is good - very close to light rail and not far from down town at all. I liked playing with the dog - friendly and playful. \n\nI would definitely come back again next time I am in Seattle (unless its winter and freezing cold ha)\n\nMy only suggestion to people staying is to bring earplugs (as I would camping anywhere). The planes flying over usually stop at night but you need them if you want a lay in, as they fly pretty low. earplugs do the trick though."

The  flat was clean and roomy. We hope to stay again on our next trip to Seattle!"

I felt completely safe in her home and was able to explore some great areas in Seattle by foot. If you're ever in doubt about what to do or eat, Pat also has some wonderful ideas. I was pretty bummed that I had to leave Seattle so soon."

Short drive to the cute shops/restaurants off Edmunds, and there are very decent Thai and Mediterranean restaurants within the community as well for convenient takeaway. Both Lynette and Kevin were hospitable friendly hosts, couldn't have asked for an easier trouble-free stay. Very clean space which is so important. This is a great deal, recommend. "

The place was clean comfy and cozy with great coffee;) They had great hot water and with it being a little chilly out that was awesome to come back too.  They really had everything you need. I was so happy they had a hairdryer available since I had left mine at home.  The spacer heater in the bed room is a great idea just to get the room a little warmer before you sleep. We never had to have it on for long. Just a great plus. Dave and Visala were very nice. We would definitely go back. Thank so much! "

It is close to I-90 so you could travel to the East Side easily.  \n\nDon't hesitate to rent from them. It's great value and a perfect short-term rental for a couple, or even a small kid too!

The house was in pristine condition and incredibly clean.  What was particularly helpful for us was having rooms spread across three floors because there were toddlers and adults, and it was a good way to isolate the noise so people with different sleep schedules can sleep.  The beds were comfortable, sheets clean, and the kitchen fully stocked for us to cook a number of home-cooked meals.  Ample closet space and the nice in-unit laundry system was incredibly convenient.  The electronic keyless access was also convenient  helped as to get in and out easily.  The neighborhood is quiet and grocery store very close, without being too far from the heart of downtown.  Martha was able to accommodate an early check-in and she was a very low-maintenance easy host overall.  Our entire family loved this place and would definitely stay again! "

He gave me tips on where to shop for food and to get local services. And anytime I needed him to sort something out in the apartment he was there in minutes. It is the best place to be in Seattle if you are visiting for a short time."

She was easy to communicate with and the entire process was streamlined. The location is perfect for anyone looking to checkout the downtown area or Capitol Hill. Great places to eat within walking distance, and very fun nightlife. My only difficulty during my stay was the parking, since I rented a car. If there was no parking on Broadway St. the other parking was 4 hour parking only. Other than that I would recommend Claire's place to everyone. "

Staying on the rooftop with downtown in front of you is impressing. The rooms are clean with nice furniture in it. The location is great and all the great neighborhoods with bars and restaurants are only a couple of minutes away. Alex, his girlfriend and their dog are really nice and easy. We recommend this place and would stay there again any time. "

Abil and Melissa are the sweetest gals around, paired with their lovely and helpful assistant, Courtney and the gorgeous old house, it's essentially heaven. Fresh fruit with homemade muffins in the morning and the potting shed were my two favorite bonuses of staying here. Abil, Melissa, and Courtney have impeccable taste and can recommend excellent restaurants, beers, vintage, music, burlesque, shops, nature or anything you could ask! Check out their library if you have some downtime. If you hate cats, they stay out of the way and you'll barely see them. If you love cats, Perla is evasive but El Gato will soak up your pets and scratches like a big, adorable, sleepy cat-sponge. Bed, baked, and beyond is so wonderful, I can't wait to find another reason to visit Seattle again!"

The kitchen is fully equipped and functional though we only cooked breakfast while there.  The dining and living rooms are spacious, nicely decorated and great places to just hang around. There is no doubt that the next time we're in Seattle it will be at Riani's. "

It was was easy to get around to other neighborhoods in Seattle from Phinneywood, too! Sea To Sky rentals was very easy to work with. They were super accommodating, even when there was a technology glitch within AirBnB with booking. They are very communicative and transparent with the listing as well as the directions for arrival/departure. We plan on returning to Phinneywood Bungalow! "

Her daughter Rachel greeted me with scrumptious homemade chocolate chip cookies.    We had an interesting conversation, and then I had an extremely comfortable sleep on a good bed in a nice dark, quiet room. \n\n I especially appreciated having a place to park in the city that is so bustling with so many streets lined with vehicles.  It was a stress-free experience.  "

It was exactly what we were looking for - something in a more residential area, but with lots to enjoy in the immediate neighborhood.\n\nThe Capitol Hill neighborhood was great. The house was only 2 blocks from a huge QFC which came in handy when we ate in, but there were also a lot of restaurants and cafes within walking distance as well. Downtown was very close, a short 10 minutes by car.\n\nPeter was a great host - reaching out to make sure we had arrived safely and responding very quickly when we had questions. \n\nWe would definitely stay here again and would highly recommend this property!"

The room was great - two comfortable beds, tastefully decorated, and all the amenities you would hope for.   \n\nThe downstairs areas were absolutely incredible and are the main reason I would highly recommend staying here.  The hot tub and shower room is enormous (20ft+ ceilings), beautifully lit, and filled with amazing paintings.   Showering in that room in the morning was the best way to wake up."

        "comments": "The situation was more or less like a hostel, only a tier more expensive, and a bit more interpersonal.  I thought the company was okay at the time I was there, but I imagine it's a crapshoot what kind of people are going to be there at any given time.  Maybe it speaks to the narrowness of my own interests, but I didn't have a lot to talk about with most of the people I encountered about their projects.  But you can be reasonably sure you won't be sharing space with obnoxious party-types of the kind endemic to typical hostels; pretty much everyone there was a professional of some type and understood the value of a good night's sleep.\n\nWasn't thrilled with the fact that I didn't get responses to questions I sent the day before through AirBnB until I got there and started calling people around check-in time.  Also, the shower/tub was blocked up during the time I was staying there, although I get the impression the management is probably going to do something about that, since it was brought up by them about halfway through my 8 day stay.  However, it wasn't fixed in the remaining 4 days, so who knows.\n\nYou could do worse than staying here, but I don't know that it lived up to the hype of being a \"hackerspace\".  Location's great, at any rate, which is probably the biggest reason to recommend it.\n"

The street is fairly busy, and you can hear people coming and going in the apartment block so light sleepers might find this an issue (we didn't as we're used to city noise!)."

Their property is situated across from the local community garden and in front of the local orchard & within walking distance to Seward Park (don't miss it!).  The space itself is clean, well decorated and stocked full of all the necessities; blow dryer, tea, mixing bowls, you name it!\n\nBarbara and Bill are also great hosts.

THE BIG SURPERISED the apartment was not ready (the linen in the bed and towels in the bathroom were all used and dirty and there was no clean one to used) and No one to contact NO Company to call NO host this KARA to answer and we (my wife and my son and myself) were extremely tired from the trip and the only solution was to find any place to sleep and by the help of the concierge lady we find two rooms in Hotel Max which is few steps from the building . Next morning we found out the whole company is off for some Jewish holiday and there be No cleaning because of the holiday and they will try to send the cleaning people by Wed. 16 Sept. so we have to stay another night in the Hotel ( it coast me more than $900 )\nFinally by Wed Sept 16 at 3:00 p.m. we checked in the apartment. This is my bad start at this accommodation \nThe good side was the location is super , the people working are very nice and helpful.\nThe only two good things that the company did trying to compensate me 1) get me the parking fob for the garage ( although the concierge people offer me a fob for the whole period (28 days) for only $200) .\n2) They exchange the sofa bed   with new one after complaint about the old one \nThis is my story I am not happy and I dont think I will use your service again.

To sum it up we had a cozy space of our own, hosted by kind and lovely people, in the perfect location for our needs. \nLoved it!\n\n"

From the initial conversation with the host (answering my many questions) to making sure I was prepared for check-in.  The apartment itself had all the amenities of home, including fantastic tips on local areas (some popular, some lesser known).  Location is fantastic, within walking distance to major Seattle attractions and fantastic restaurants/bars are steps away from the front door.  \n\nBest of all, this place is just...complete.  What do I mean?  Many other airbnb listings seem to throw together features to form one complete place, quite reminiscent of my bachelor days.  This place is so well put together that I'm now re-evaluating the choices I've made in my own home!\n\nI'll definitely be staying here when I visit Seattle again.  Thanks Darik and to all the team members that were a part of my stay."

Ian made my transition to Seattle extremely easy and calmed several of my fears. Ian is extremely welcoming and is focused on making you feel as 'at home' as possible. On top of making me feel welcome in his home, he was always giving me excellent ideas for places to eat, take my dog or grab a beer. At the end of the month it was difficult to leave such an ideal situation!"

The open design with the kitchen, living room and dinning room, create an easy place to host nearby relatives. There are 3 bedrooms and 2 full baths upstairs and a TV room that converts into a 4th bedroom on the main floor with a half-bath. The hot tub on the roof was a welcome addition. There is a deck off the main floor and a nice sitting area on the roof. It would be a great place to stay in the summer, where one could take full advantage of the deck and roof. In summary, this is a great place to stay in Seattle, and wonderful for large gatherings. Only caveat, we did wake up every weekday morning at 7am to construction noise across the street. This also created congestion for street parking. I suspect this will be done by spring."

I very much appreciated her quick responses -- especially with a last minute request as I was on my way out of town! The apartment itself was really cute. While there is no real living area to hang out, I didn't really need it. This may be an issue if you're planning to spend a lot of time in the apartment but I didn't mind it at all. Everything was extremely clean and well kept. As Marne mentions, she does have young kids and you will hear them in the morning but I didn't find it to be an issue at all -- in fact, I quite enjoyed hearing a little bit of piano on one of the mornings! My only suggestion would be to bring layers to sleep in if the heat is going to be on as there is no way to adjust how hot the bedroom gets, and the heat does come on full force. But Marne gave me a heads up so it wasn't an issue. I would definitely stay at her place again! "

I read in another review that there was only a curtain separating the bathroom from the bed, which made me a little nervous, but I didn't think it would be right next to the bed.  For my fiancee and I, staying here was too close for comfort - this would probably be okay for someone staying here by themselves.\n\nThe space was clean, but I didn't feel like the photos adequately represented the exact dimensions of the room.  The curtains in our room (there weren't any blinds) were sheer, and didn't cover the entire windows, which looked out onto the street.  The bed was comfortable and spacious, but was steps from the toilet, which was separated only by a curtain.  In addition, we were unable to get the wifi working, despite trying two different networks on three different devices.\n\nIn summary, this is probably an inappropriate space for a couple due to the lack of personal space between the bed and toilet.  We booked this room because it was inexpensive and we needed a place to stay for only one night, but we stayed at a different location for $85 a night (this space was $70) with a separate bathroom that felt like we were staying in a hotel, in a similar part of town.

Everything was clean and well thought out. Lisa has clear instructions and notes everywhere to really make you feel at home. Little touches like a pitcher of filtered water in the fridge and extra blankets in a basket near the bed really made it a nice experience. \n\nThe house is centrally located, and I was able to walk to tons of great restaurants, coffee shops, and shopping on Ballard Ave. \n\nI would highly recommend this spot for a visit to the lovely city of Seattle.

This is our first trip to US and Steve has been very helpful to point out the right places to visit and many a times has even taken us with him.\n\nAbout the house, one thing I really liked is that it is decorated with artifacts belonging to the Soviet era. The house is spacious and has enough room for 4 people. \n\nOur initial plan was to stay here for 2 weeks and then move to another place, but we like it so much, that we are now staying here for the whole trip.

It was super convenient to get to and was very nicely situated in a great neighbourhood with lots of close amenities.  Great coffee shop 2 blocks away, and a nice breakfast joint as well.  There is a Whole Foods just down the hill which we walked to a few times.  \n\nAlso i have to say that Paige was nice to converse with and easy to ask questions to and the booking process was very accommodating.  We had a great stay at Paige's and Seattle, and we would definitely stay here again.  We definitely can recommend this place.\n\nThanks Paige!"

About 3-5 mins by car there are supermarkets like Safeway and Fred Meyers and gas stations. There is a more expensive high quality food market in the centre of Fremont.\nRachel kindly provided a parking pass for our rental car. The pictures show 2 childrens beds. In reality these are now full size 1 person beds. The house has a lot of facilities, but we missed a dish washer. \nWe definitely recommend visiting Theo Chocolate in Fremont!\nWe also went to the Boeing factory tour and downtown Seattle. And we made a nice 2.5 hr walk in Discovery Park to the lighthouse and back. "

I'm a tall guy at almost 6'4\" so the shower is at an angle, you can really only fit one at a time in there but can soak in the bathtub if you want. Barry ended up offering us a ride to the train station and we found out we both work in the same field! It was such a pleasant trip I would definitely stay there again. Oh they also gifted us some delicious walnut holiday dessert bread and wished us a Merry Christmas; so very kind hearted."

        "comments": "Daniela was a great host. Arriving at the unit presented a couple of slight disappointments - not with the unit as much as its' readiness - and she immediately corrected everything. Daniela had just taken over management of this unit so seeing her provide the solutions right away meant more to me than a perfect arrival.\n\nThe apt unit became home over the two weeks we were there. The area is GREAT! My friend from California needed to be in the heart of downtown while I was away at the office during the day - this location was perfect!\n\nDrawbacks to the apt unit is that many of the wall outlets needed messing with to get equipment to charge. Parking leaves a lot to be desired - it is doable to find parking just outside the door, but the owner not offering the garage parking is a significant negative. Another one is that the apt is not truly stocked with food and very little coffee, even. Compared to other Air BnB places I have rented this one was the least \"stocked\". The size of the refrigerator, microwave and stove/over, however, made for a quick remedy to that once we went out to the stores to buy food, drink, etc.\n\nWe found that although many of the tenants owned dogs, we never heard a dog bark, even once, during the two weeks. People were friendly, happy and conversant. My friend from California has an unforgettable memory of her first trip to Seattle, and this apt and it's decor, views of the bay and location, entirely contributes to that perfect memory. "

Booking was instant and very easy.  We worked with Michael and he immediately answered any and all  questions we had, even on Thanksgiving day! Michael gave us an extensive list of restaurants all within walking distance and all highly reviewed.   We Absolutely loved the apartment and it's clean modern decor.  The view was Beyond Spectacular from  both the living area and the bedroom.  Additionally there is a rooftop common area with even better views! Both indoor and outdoor spaces have a cool, contemporary decor.   The kitchen in the apt. is stocked with the essentials for cooking and dining for 2-4 ppl.  It's only a couple of blocks to Walk to Pike Place to shop and prepare our own fresh meals and dine with the most spectacular VIEW!  There were a few essentials missing; ironing board, hairdryer, extra blankets etc.  I messaged Michael that we could live without them for this trip, but should be there for the next guests.  We were out at the time I messaged, and when we returned every single item I had listed was waiting for us at the front door along with a bottle of wine!  The Location was perfect for us, It's a nice walk to the EMP Museum at the Seattle Center and all it has to offer.  We rented bikes and rode to a tailgate party near Century Link and Safeco Fields (though it's a walkable distance).  With the bikes we rode to Freemont, Gasworks Park and the Ballard Locks.  Took the Ferry to Bainbridge Island where you can easily ride around the island (note easy walk to Seattle Ferry dock and once on Bainbridge 2 block walk up to town to shop and dine for the day - no bikes necessary) We rode along the Elliot Bay Bike Trail North, and South around to West Seattle (or you can take the West Seattle Water Taxi for a spectacular view of the city - and some nice eateries and a beach.  With bikes  we could ride to the Fauntleroy Ferry and to Vashon Island as well.  LOVE THIS CITY and this apt. with it's Views made it  one of the best vacations we have ever had - we will definitely be back!\nThank you Michael etal."

Inside, antiques were everywhere!! Especially loved the stained glass lampshades--- most hanging fixtures were as old as the house. There was plenty of room & was comfortable. The kitchen was roomy & well equipped. LOVED the green space in the backyard!! Having to walk thru a bedroom to get to the main bathroom, wasn't too convenient, but manageable. Would recommend this house to others!!"

Highlights: the freshest rainbow chard and herbs from the outdoor garden; queer friendly; Zane the sweetest cat; Ane helped me get in touch with someone for my research (the reason I was in town)! "

In my opinion, if everything is done, it will be very awesome experience for intern or exchanged student for short period of time. Timo is very friendly and funny. I will definitely miss him. However, during the period I stayed, I might face some difficulties about laundry which is not finish since I came till I left. It was a good offer to stay at another house in the first week because this home didn't finish yet. But actually my main reason that I chose the house near UW because I don't want to pay bus fare. After I maintain moving to this house, my room wasn't well painted. Anyway I may get compensation by getting 1 person per room. I do confirm that if everything is done (you should ask the detail first), it will be very awesome. When you read this comment, everything may finish already. So if I cut the bad thing which can be finished in the future, I can comment this 5 stars!!"

When I had some down time Bethany offered to take me around the neighborhood and show me the sights. She was very knowledgable about the area.

She was always just a text away if we needed her and was quick to reply. The apartment was well kitted out in terms of toiletries and appliances.  The apartment was conveniently located near bus stops for easy access to the city centre and other locations, along with a cheap food store.\n\nOverall staying at Julie's place was a positive experience but I can't give it 5 stars due to certain things personally affecting me and my boyfriend. Others may have no issues with the following:\n\nAs we were out of town during Christmas we were relying on wifi to Skype home. We had issues with quality and connectivity. It would often drop connection and then reconnect moments later.\nThe heating system would activate periodically through out the night, sometimes it would wake us sometimes it wouldn't. If you were a light sleeper I could see it being an problem.\nThe bed while comfy and cozy was small for two people. \n\nAs I said it was a positive experience and if the above doesn't trouble you then I would highly recommend staying here.\n"

We were able to take a short walk to all of the \"must see\" places for tourists (e.g., Space Needle, market), and on the way, spotted dozens of restaurants, pubs, and coffee shops that we knew we wouldn't get to on this trip but filed away for future reference. We did not cook but saw that the kitchen was well appointed if we'd wanted to have a cozy dinner in the studio.  The bakery on the 1st Ave side of the building is phenomenal. The only recommendation I'd make for future guests is to bring earplugs, as our slumber was disrupted each night by what sounded like stomping on the floor directly above the bed. "

The location and house are wonderful, and it was perfect for us as we had our son and his family (a 4 year old and an infant) with us.  The crib and changing table were blessings as they drove up from Portland and didn't have to bring much baby equipment.  They also loved the fun and creative toys.  We loved the place, highly recommend it, and would be glad to stay again.  "

They were very welcoming in their messages to us and left a very nice bottle of red wine waiting for us at arrival.  The location was excellent for us, and the home is very comfortable and had plenty of room for myself, wife, daughter and son-in-law.  It has a wonderful front deck with bay view.  It is very well maintained and furnished very nicely with nice finishes.  The kitchen and dining area is very nice and well equipped, and we loved the commercial range for cooking our Thanksgiving dinner for the four of us plus my son and his wife.  The master bedroom and large downstairs room had wonderful beds, linens, and towels.  The master and main floor bathrooms are very nice.  The house manual has very complete information and it is well organized.  In a word everything worked out perfectly, and we left very happy and satisfied.  This was our first experience using Airbnb and needless to say it was a very good one. "

The neighborhood was really nice and we loved that there were plenty of places to eat at within a few blocks.  Amy also gave us some great recommendations.

The accomms deliver as pictured and advertised, with very detailed notes provided both upon booking as well as posted around the communal space. As a frequent traveler, I appreciated the ease of transaction, the thoroughness of communication, and both the styling and cleanliness of the accommodation itself\u2014thanks Dirk and Jaq! **I'm starring this one for a return visit! \n\nTraveler's Tip: check out Elm Coffee Roasters and The London Plane just down Main (toward 2nd Ave S). Also: Spur Gastropub delivered upon expectation. Enjoy Seattle, folks!)"

We walked just a few blocks down to a really cute neighborhood within Capitol Hill, lots of places to eat and shop. We walked down  further and had more restaurant, coffee shop and shopping options. We walked even further and enjoy the walk to Pikes Place Market and enjoyed the other sightseeing that was available in the area. \n\nI would highly recommend staying here. I completely fell in love with Seattle. Matt was a great host and he was very friendly and helpful. I have nothing but good things to say about my stay. "

Great location, comfortable, cute, and well-equipped house, great communication.  We usually aren't as comfortable staying in someone's primary residence, but Justin and his wife went to great efforts to help us feel like we weren't displacing them from their home.  In fact, I am inspired to emulate some of their organizational and decorating ideas.\n\nThe house was cheerily decorated for Christmas.  It was spotless and cozy.  We loved the open plan centered around the fireplace and enjoyed spending Christmas Day there with our daughter and her boyfriend.  We would certainly rent this home again.  We'd love to visit in the summer when the lovely deck could be put to use.\n\nHighest recommendation!"

If you enjoy the charm and character of old buildings and architecture, you will enjoy staying at Talitha's. The air outside was unusually muggy and smoky from forest fires and Talitha was thoughtful enough to provide cold, fresh fruit and water which was so refreshing at the end of the day. Couple things to note: you will definitely hear the neighbors moving about, although infrequently, but if you're not used to apartment living, this may bother you. Also, as a person of tall stature (6 ft.), I found the lower height of the shower-head a bit challenging, however the rest of the apartment is very open, airy and spacious. Nice comfy bed, lovely ambiance and great neighborhood access to restaurants and nightlife. Stay here! "

There were labels on every important item and drawer in the kitchen, which made the space feel surprisingly welcome. We can't even begin to describe how wonderful it was!

This is a critical part of the AirBnB experience to me -- knowing who you're dealing with and getting their perspective on the community. Also, only the owners know how the house is set up. \n2. The management company, Pillow, is pretty incompetent. I had problems getting my key (the instructions were vague). I called them twice, waiting 15 rings (!) before someone picked up. That person then just repeated the same vague instructions. Unhelpful. \n3. THEY WANTED TO CHARGE ME $25 FOR AN EXTRA PILLOW. And wouldn't give extra blankets. The house is *huge*. Surely there's an extra pillow somewhere? But all the cabinets were locked.  Because of bad pillows, I spent most of Sunday with pretty nasty neck pain. \n4. Never in my entire AirBnB history can I remember someone refusing to let us check out after 11am. \n5. Uncomfortable, cheap linens, thin pillows, and comforters that obviously came from the management co.\n\n\nI bet the owners are kind people, and the house *is* beautiful. But having an incompetent management company really ruined this. "

When we arrived at her house, the room was clean and well kept. She even provided some chocolates and a welcome note on the night we arrived. She provided some great recommendations for sights in Seattle, including the Chihuly Glass Museum, which ended up being my favorite spot in the whole the city. All in all, she's a very sweet host  with a beautiful home. "

It is beautifully finished and decorated and my mom reports that the bed is very comfy! I will definitely recommend Linda and Robert's to friends and family visiting in the future."

The house was extremely clean and looked exactly like the pictures. It was in the perfect area of town too. So much good food and right down the street! There were 5 of us, and it didn't feel crowded at all! It felt private too, just how a vacation should feel. We would definitely stay here again! In fact we look forward to it! "

The room itself is cozy and welcoming, his place is serene and located in West Seattle perfectly placed. A bus ride into the city proper,  another bus to Alki Beach, water taxi to the other side of the bay. All these things I would not have experienced if not for David's local knowledge. You often get out of what you give, our new friendship is exactly what I think Airbnb can be at its best. Host and guest in perfect synchronicity as to how much interaction one needed. We must be the poster child for a great experience.  Seattle is beautiful and my host's tips and willingness to show me around as I was on my own very sweet. In short, Airbnb have me the holiday I could not have imagined because of my host. Thanks to both of you!"

We were the first guests ever, and the place was just perfect! Exactly as pictured and described and so much more!! It was like staying in a spa, with pampering products in the bath, big fluffy towels and bath sheet size towels as well.  And the beds and bedding were like sleeping on a cloud!\n\nAnd then there is the view! 180 degree view of Elliot Bay, and beautiful patio furniture to lounge on while taking in the sight. We enjoyed the fire pit several nights, and even cooked on the grill one night. We met several of the neighbors, and everyone was so friendly!\n\nIf you can bring yourself to venture out, there are many fun restaurants within an easy walk down the beach. The Alki Beach area is a great place to be.  We were definitely sad when it was time to leave! I will definitely be back some day if I can :)"

The house was warm and the temperature consistent despite some rather cold rainy weather, the house stayed nice and warm. There were, however, not a lot of amenities for our party of 7 adults, with insufficient seating in the living room and dining area. The pull out couch was very uncomfortable and the remarkably limited cable service was disappointing for a winter stay that included a lot of inside time. Throwing the trash away was also a bit of a challenge, since the trash bins were located in the alley way behind the property, and we could find no way to access from the house without walking around the corner to empty our trash "

Personal toilet articles (toothbrushes, make up, used soap, shampoo and conditioner) were left out on the bathroom counters and in the showers. The dining \nroom table still had crumbs on it and we had to clean the living room sofa table with windex in order to even utilize the that room.\n\nIt appears that little or no effort was made to clean or otherwise make the residence hospitable for guests, especially paying guests.

It really does have everything you need: the bed is cozy and warm (with an awesome electric mattress pad); the bathroom os with equipped towels and toiletries; washer and dryer and mini fridge with utensils and tupperware are available; and what's more, there are lots of little extra touches, like a coffee-maker, bus route lists, pamphlets about the city, slippers to wear in the studio, and of course, the binder full of info and recommendations.\n\nThe location is great - there is a direct bus into downtown that only takes 20-30 minutes and Ballard is just 15 minutes to the north. We used Car-to-Go and Uber a lot as well and nothing was very expensive.\nFinding the place and getting the keys was super easy.\n\nWe came just after there were a bunch of flooding alerts in the area and there had been a lot of rain. This was probably the reason that the studio's sump pump gave us some trouble. We had to stop using the plumbing in the apartment, but we told Diane about it right away and she invited us to use her bathroom in the morning and then was able to get the sump pump fixed the next day! In the end, we were actually happy that the turn of events allowed us to get to know Diane and her dog, Stella, a bit better!\n\nI whole-heatedly recommend Diane and her Little Urban Studio!"

The Apartment itself had a great view of the tall buildings and had a huge sliding door to let in the sounds, smells and atmosphere of a bustling city. Shelli was a gracious host meeting us outside at the curb and escorting us to the Apt. all amenities were provided including a fully appointed kitchen and washer and dryer. the bed was queen sized and the TV had a full cable package. the building itself is wonderful, nicely appointed and considered a jewel in the city by locals that know of it. there are some must stops that everybody needs to visit 1) \"Vonn's 1000 sprits\" it's attached to the building street level, best pasta and comfort food we had in Seattle. the atmosphere was a 10, then \"Fonte coffee\" just north about 100' early breakfast too. and lastly \"Lecosho\" just down the steps towards the harbor, best Italian food and reasonable in $. PS the name of the Apt. building is called \"Harbor Steps\" google it."

Gabbi offered to lend us a little litter box during our stay which was very helpful! Seattle unseasonably cold during the five days we were there. Gabbi offered to purchase some extra heaters to keep the place warm. After warming it up it once stayed warm without much heat after that. Very cozy! \nWhen we arrived she stocked the cupboards with tea, coffee and instant oatmeal. There is a full stove and refrigerator but no microwave. I loved that she had a compost, recycling and trash container for our use and a basket of toiletries in the bathroom too! There is a little CD/radio on the kitchen counter so you can play music if you wish. She also had a basket with a small selection of toys and books for kids plus a few books on the book shelves for the adults. That was nice a nice touch if we wanted something to read during our stay. \nThe Greenwood neighborhood is great! There are lots of independents shops, restaurants, coffee shops and a grocery store to walk to for all of your needs. It's also a direct shot from the I-5 freeway making it easy to get to!\nGabbi was very kind and helpful to us before and during our stay at her cottage. I would definitely recommend her place! "

However, we were a little bummed to arrive and realize there was no closet available and nowhere else to unpack or even put our suitcases (the bed takes up the entire room) - if you're traveling with bigger bags (or more than one suitcase), expect a tight fit. Also don't expect to watch the news - while there was a TV in the apartment, it's not hooked up to any devices (cable, DVD player, etc), so we were a little let down that when we chose to stay in for a night,  hanging out to watch a movie or show wasn't an option for us..."

This location is best for those not traveling with a car and who want to explore all that Seattle has to offer. The location is amazing, just a few blocks from Pike Place Market and the Symphony, one block from the light rail station, kitty corner from the art museum, etc. The place is great esp if you plant to spend most of your time out in the city. Note: There is no AC for the summer time and even with the fan provided it was very uncomfortable. "

The guide also included places to eat/things to do in the neighborhood and in Seattle.  The house is amazing! The pictures are spot on.  Waking up every morning was a treat with the beautiful orange and yellow colors of the tree outside the window and going on the balcony with a cup of coffee and a view of the city.  Cam is a nice and welcoming guy and he responds quickly to any question you have.  Stella is so cute and friendly!  Parking was easy to find and is very close to the house.  The town is beautiful and very safe.  Everything is within walking distance and the bus is easy to take too.  Pike place market is a short bus ride and is a lot cheaper than driving.  I stayed here for a month and I can't think of anything negative about the place or my experience.  I would definitely book this place again! "

Joyce was extremely accommodating and available if we had any questions.  The house was very clean, the beds were very comfortable, and Joyce generously left us some yummy treats! The location was perfect \u2013 you could pretty much walk anywhere you needed to.  It was just a 2 block walk to the Wallingford Playground which was a hit with our 3 year old family member! It\u2019s an old house with hardwood floors, which makes it full of character and very beautiful, but noise does carry quite a bit. We were a little worried about disrupting Joyce as she was staying in the downstairs suite, but she was graciously tolerant of what we can imagine was quite a bit of noise (with 6 adults, a toddler, a dog and a few visitors). We would highly recommend Joyce\u2019s house as a great place to stay in Seattle. "

We never felt rushed or anything about checking in and out, as they were really accommodating. The apartment was amazing... spacious, cozy, and clean, and in an awesome location. I felt like I was just casually staying over at a good friend's place!\nBoth Rachel and Sarah offered suggestions as to where to go. I'd never been to Seattle before and wanted to make the most out of my trip, and thanks to their friendliness and suggestions, I ended up experiencing more than I'd hoped for!"

It is definitely a bit like house sitting for a friend who happens to have an older house (right down to the bathroom door that sometimes locks itself and the interesting tilted floors), and it's a fun space to spend time in. We had fun watching netflix and playing with one of the guitars hanging on the walls (picks provided in a dish on the coffee table) while nibbling on thoughtfully provided candy and watching the dogs snore by our feet. Fun little space!"

The room and bathroom are in excellent condition, he has very nice cookware, and .  The apartment is a short walk from Whole Foods and easy bus ride to both downtown and Ballard.  That picture from the balcony isn't photoshopped, it provides a truly awesome view of the city.\n\nNicolaus is super tech savy and extremely environmentally conscious, making his place an interesting (in a good way!) place to stay.  He's constantly looking for ways to improve his guests' experience, and he actually bought a new bed for the guest room while we were there, turning a good sleeping situation into a fantastic one.  We shared several meals (he cooked for us a few times, and we returned the favor) and enjoyed hours of conversation.  He has a great sense of humor, is as exceptionally easy going, and we 100% recommend staying with him!  "

There is a great view of the water from the living room and a nice view of the Colombia Tower from the bedrooms. Bedrooms have great insulation, and rooms were spacious enough, with very nice furnishings. Beds were comfortable and everything seemed clean. One of my friends that joined on the trip is very picky when it comes to bathrooms, but was very pleased to find out how clean these were. The only complaints I have would be that the bathtubs were a bit slippery and the hot water would stall when more than one person would try to shower at a time. Other than that we loved our stay and would definitely recommend it. Thanks Gene!"

Breeze and her husband, Kartik, provided everything (and more!) that we needed to make our 5th anniversary celebration weekend in Seattle phenomenal. Bedding and bath were comfortable and luxurious; the heated floors in the bathroom were a wonderful bonus on drizzly days. The well-appointed kitchen boasted dual refrigerators, sink, ice maker, toaster oven, microwave, hot plate, Nespresso machine, french press coffeemaker, and more and was well-stocked with gourmet coffee grounds, Nespresso pods in multiple flavors, flavored sparkling waters, local brews, chocolates and even a bottle of wine. We had some trouble establishing the wireless connection for cable television the first night at the apartment and Breeze and Kartik were incredibly quick to follow up with us. Within hours of our message, all of the kinks with the television were ironed out and the system was working perfectly. The neighborhood surrounding the apartment is a huge bonus. The streets are quiet and tree-lined and there are several parks within walking distance. We also loved that we were no more than 4 blocks from grocery and retail stores and great restaurants like Ethan Stowell's How to Cook a Wolf. Public transit has a pick up merely one block from the house which is convenient for trips downtown and beyond. Uber also services the neighborhood. We relied primarily on Uber and spent approximately $8-$14 per one way trip around town - Fremont, Capitol Hill, Downtown, etc. If you have the chance to book this gorgeous space, do it! For the extremely reasonable price, you won't find a hotel with amenities as posh as this. Thanks again to both Breeze and Kartik for an incredible experience!"

Neighborhood wasn't a bad place and like everyone else has said it is true to be right between capital hill and downtown, walking distance to both areas or just a quick $5 Uber. Perfect little apartment for 2 people to stay, we felt very comfortable and at home. If you're tall you might have a hard time with the low shower head as my boyfriend did but definitely wasn't a big enough problem where we wouldn't stay there again. Kitchen is very small and refrigerator is tiny but we didn't need it for more than a few of our beers anyways :) and morning drinks at the kitchen table or on the couch is an awesome unique view of Seattle and Paramount Theater.

It's spacious, quiet, and warm. The bed is probably the most comfortable bed I've ever slept on in my life. Slept like a rock. \n\nIt was a very cold night so we Uber'd to the Space Needle but walked back. In the morning, we walked to The Market as well. Everything's close and easy to get to. \n\nWe never got to meet Blake Lively though. Ah well."

I briefly met Allison and she was very lovely and accommodating, even when I had to call her at 1am to find my way to her place! If you're in the area I would definitely recommend staying at her home!"

Many restaurants and even a nice pub just one block away. The place is cozy and has everything you may need on your stay. Great access to public transit, although the Seattle transit system could be better. Ended up taking lyft and uber everywhere. They were able to pick us up within 3-4 minutes every time as this is a very central location to everything. If you clean up after yourself you can save yourself a cleaning fee which is fantastic. We had all appliances available to us, although we did not use any as we visited Seattle to try out their great food and coffee! Overall I cannot recommend this place enough."

Here's the scoop about what you will expect:  key code for entry, quite and safe neighbourhood, comfortable room, private washroom, and available computer/TV in the room with accessible USB ports on the desk for your  charging needs.  Also, he reserved space in the fridge for us and it was very convenient to prepare food.  The icing on the cake, however, is the warmth and depth to this Man. What a knowledgeable person! If you need pointers about and around  the city, he is helpful. Another key point for planning needs, he is very responsive to messages."

Clearly, this is an airbnb rental for a niche audience, but if you are looking to stay in Seattle in a really unique setting, I highly recommend staying in this house! Hal was out of town while we were there, but his house sitter (Sunny) was super responsive. I'd definitely recommend watching the video to see all of the ins and outs of the house beforehand / when you arrive. This was perfect for what we were looking for - a weekend in a tiny home :)"

We would definitely stay here again if we came back to Queen Anne ! "

I loved the convenience of being able to jump to downtown or over to Ballard from this location. Val and the Pillow team were friendly and quick to respond. The entire visit from pre check-in to following up at the end was great. Should I find myself needing a quiet space for a getaway retreat to Seattle I will absolutely stay here again."

Pam was a sweet host and she introduced me the kitchen so I can help myself if she's not around. The room itself is small but with a large closet. You can definitely see the lake from your window. The only imperfect thing might be the whistle from the port in the morning if you are sensitive to the noise. It didn't bother me anyway."

The separate entrance and parking space really made it convenient. We didn't drive much as it was a short walk down the hill to the D Line which takes you right downtown.  Having a kitchen was an extra bonus. The kitchen had everything we needed. We cooked two meals a day and went out for one - which saved us lots of money. We would definitely stay there again. Thank you Becky!"
